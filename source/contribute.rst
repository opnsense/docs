* Help fixing issues as well as by
* Contributing new functionality
* Share your code with the project by manner of a pull request.

.. Note::

  :doc:`support`. It is important for plugin developers to maintain their plugin and interact with users for QA.

---------------

Testing
-------
Contribute by testing the latest development version to make the next release even
better than the last. If you like to test a development version then the easiest
way is to login to the console and type:

::

  pkg install -y opnsense-devel


And to revert back to the production version:

::

  pkg install -y opnsense


That is all there is to it to test the latest development release.
Development releases are usually built at the same day the latest production
release comes available.

------------------
Issues can be easily reported on github, please consider carefully if the issue
could be a configuration or user error before reporting it. If you are unsure,
report you issue on the `Forum <https://forum.opnsense.org>`__ or on IRC/Freenode (#opnsense).

manual </develop>` and checkout our `roadmap <https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/>`__ as well as our `issue tracker <https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues>`__.
Before starting it is always a good to share your idea first with a core developer,
to do so you can use either:

* `github <https://github.com/opnsense/core/>`__ and  `create a issue <https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues/new>`__
