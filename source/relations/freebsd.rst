Relations with OPNsense
-----------------------
OPNsense is built on top of FreeBSD. The aim of the OPNsense team is to stay as
close to the original source as possible. OPNsense can be installed on
a standard FreeBSD installation, this way a hosted system can be converted
easily to run OPNsense. A bootstrap script is available to make the installation
process a joyful experience.

.. Seealso::

  To convert your FreeBSD hosted installation to OPNsense, see the OPNsense
  bootstrap script on `OPNsense's update tools @ github <https://github.com/opnsense/update/>`__
