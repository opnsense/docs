Introduction
------------

Founded in 2014 by Oliver Pinter and Shawn Webb, HardenedBSD is a
security-enhanced fork of FreeBSD. The HardenedBSD Project is implementing many
exploit mitigation and security technologies on top of FreeBSD.
The project started with Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as an initial
focal point and is now implementing further exploit mitigation techniques.

-----------------
Why Fork FreeBSD?
-----------------

HardenedBSD forked the FreeBSD codebase for ease of development. Prior to
HardenedBSD's founding, Oliver and Shawn worked on separate repositories,
occasionally causing collaboration issues. Unifying the codebases was a natural
step in efficient, effective collaboration between the two individuals.
Two years have passed since the unification of the work and HardenedBSD is
growing faster than ever.

-------------------
HardenedBSD's Goals
-------------------

HardenedBSD aims to implement innovative exploit mitigation and security
solutions for FreeBSD. We will work with FreeBSD and any other FreeBSD-based
project to include our innovations.

-------------------
Who is HardenedBSD?

Cooperation with OPNsense
