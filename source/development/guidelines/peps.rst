Python PEPs
===========

For Python code the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) apply.
See the `Python Developer's Guide <https://www.python.org/dev/>`__ for detailed
information. The most basic one is `PEP8: Style Guide for Python Code <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
Compliance with PEP8 can be checked using the `Python style guide checker <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycodestyle/>`_.
