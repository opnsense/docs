The firewall API plugin is a first step into migrating the legacy firewall components from OPNsense, although it does contain
a user interface, it's main focus is only to provide machine to machine interaction between custom applications and OPNsense
for selected features.

{% for controller in controllers %}
.. csv-table:: {{controller.type}} ({{controller.filename}}) {% if not controller.is_abstract %} -- extends : {{controller.base_class}} {% endif %}
   :header: "Method", "Module", "Controller", "Command", "Parameters"
   :widths: 4, 15, 15, 30, 40
{%     for endpoint in controller.endpoints %}
    "``{{endpoint.method}}``","{{endpoint.module}}","{{endpoint.controller}}","{{endpoint.command}}","{{endpoint.parameters}}"
{%-    endfor %}
{%-    if controller.uses %}
{%         for use in controller.uses %}
    "``<<uses>>``", "", "", "", "*{{use.type}}* `{{use.name}} <{{use.link}}>`__"
{%-        endfor %}

{% endfor %}


-----------------------
Concept
-----------------------

The firewall plugin injects rules in the standard OPNsense firewall while maintaining visibility on them in the
standard user interface.

We use our standard :code:`ApiMutableModelControllerBase` to allow crud operations on rule entries and offer a set of
specific actions to apply the new configuration.
Since firewall rules can be quite sensitive with a higher risk of lockout, we also support a rollback mechanism here,
which offers the ability to rollback this components changes.

.. blockdiag::
    :scale: 100%

    diagram init {
        savepoint [label = "savepoint()"];
        administration [label = "administration"];
        apply [label = "apply(savepoint)"];
        cancelRollback [label = "cancelRollback(sp)"];
        savepoint -> administration -> apply ;
        apply -> cancelRollback [label = ".. 60s", style = dashed];
    }


The diagram above contains the basic steps to change rules, apply and eventually rollback if not being able to access the machine again.
When calling :code:`savepoint()` a new config revision will be created and the timestamp will be returned for later use.
If the :code:`cancelRollback(savepoint)` is not called within 60 seconds, the firewall will rollback to the previous state
identified by the savepoint timestamp (if available).


.. Note::

    The examples in this document disable certificate validation, make sure when using this in a production environment to
    remove the :code:`verify=False` from the :code:`requests` calls

.. Tip::

    The number of versions kept can be configured as "backup count" in :menuselection:`System -> Configuration -> History`.
    This affectively determines within how many configuration changes you can still rollback, if the backup is removed, a rollback
    will keep the current state (do nothing).


-----------------------
Administration example
-----------------------

Administrative endpoints are pretty standard use of :code:`ApiMutableModelControllerBase`, the example below searches for
a rule named "OPNsense_fw_api_testrule_1", when not found one will be added otherwise it will print the internal uuid.
Inline you will find a brief description of the steps performed.


.. literalinclude:: firewall.sample_create.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: administrative_example.py


.. Tip::

      Since our model contains default values for most attributes, we only need to feed the changes if we would like to keep the
      defaults. In this case the TCP/IP version was IPv4 by default for example. In most cases one would like to set all relevant properties
      in case defaults change over time.

-----------------------
Apply / revert example
-----------------------

This example will disable the rule created in the previous example and apply the changes using a savepoint, since we're not
calling :code:`cancelRollback(savepoint)` it will revert after 60 seconds to the original state.


.. literalinclude:: firewall.savepoint.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: savepoint_example.py


.. Note::

    The savepoint will only revert this components changes, other changes won't be affected by this revert, for example
    add an additional interface between savepoint and revert won't be affected.
