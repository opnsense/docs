Firewall
~~~~~~~~

The firewall API offers a way for machine to machine interaction between custom applications and OPNsense, it
is part of the core system.

Although the module does contains a basic user interface (in :menuselection:`Firewall --> Automation`), it's mirely intended
as a reference and testbed. There's no relation to any of the rules being managed via the core system.

.. Tip::

    Use your browsers "inspect" feature to compare requests easily, the user interface in terms of communication is exactly the same
    as offered by the API . Rules not visible in the web interface (:menuselection:`Firewall --> Automation`) will not be returned by the API either.

-----------------------
Concept
-----------------------

The firewall plugin injects rules in the standard OPNsense firewall while maintaining visibility on them in the
standard user interface.

We use our standard :code:`ApiMutableModelControllerBase` to allow crud operations on rule entries and offer a set of
specific actions to apply the new configuration.
Since firewall rules can be quite sensitive with a higher risk of lockout, we also support a rollback mechanism here,
which offers the ability to rollback this components changes.

.. blockdiag::
    :scale: 100%

    diagram init {
        savepoint [label = "savepoint()"];
        administration [label = "administration"];
        apply [label = "apply(savepoint)"];
        cancelRollback [label = "cancelRollback(sp)"];
        savepoint -> administration -> apply ;
        apply -> cancelRollback [label = ".. 60s", style = dashed];
    }


The diagram above contains the basic steps to change rules, apply and eventually rollback if not being able to access the machine again.
When calling :code:`savepoint()` a new config revision will be created and the timestamp will be returned for later use.
If the :code:`cancelRollback(savepoint)` is not called within 60 seconds, the firewall will rollback to the previous state
identified by the savepoint timestamp (if available).


.. Note::

    The examples in this document disable certificate validation, make sure when using this in a production environment to
    remove the :code:`verify=False` from the :code:`requests` calls

.. Tip::

    The number of versions kept can be configured as "backup count" in :menuselection:`System -> Configuration -> History`.
    This affectively determines within how many configuration changes you can still rollback, if the backup is removed, a rollback
    will keep the current state (do nothing).


-----------------------
Administration example
-----------------------

Administrative endpoints are pretty standard use of :code:`ApiMutableModelControllerBase`, the example below searches for
a rule named "OPNsense_fw_api_testrule_1", when not found one will be added otherwise it will print the internal uuid.
Inline you will find a brief description of the steps performed.


.. literalinclude:: firewall.sample_create.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: administrative_example.py


.. Tip::

      Since our model contains default values for most attributes, we only need to feed the changes if we would like to keep the
      defaults. In this case the TCP/IP version was IPv4 by default for example. In most cases one would like to set all relevant properties
      in case defaults change over time.

-----------------------
Apply / revert example
-----------------------

This example will disable the rule created in the previous example and apply the changes using a savepoint, since we're not
calling :code:`cancelRollback(savepoint)` it will revert after 60 seconds to the original state.


.. literalinclude:: firewall.savepoint.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: savepoint_example.py


.. Note::

    The savepoint will only revert this components changes, other changes won't be affected by this revert, for example
    add an additional interface between savepoint and revert won't be affected.
