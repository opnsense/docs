Software Support Levels
------------------------

OPNsense is used in infrastructures of all sizes, in some cases it is very important to know what to expect when running into
issues, certainly if part of the knowledge to maintain the infrastructure needs to be acquired from third parties.

Our platform is easily extendable, which encourages people to work on components not directly supported by us but very valuable
to our users.

In order to offer clarity for all involved, we decided to explain how we treat the components available in this chapter.

We currently distinct three different tiers of support, ranging from Critical to Community, where critical is always directly supported
by the OPNsense® Core Team and Community you may safely assume the core team has no (or very limited) involvement.

.. Tip::

    When designing infrastructures and in need of commercial support from the creators of OPNsense for community plugins,
    you can always contact us and discuss options.


If community plugins are very popular it is possible to promote in terms of support options, but in order to grow out of
the community tier some conditions have to be met.

* The software should be usable and understandable.
* Maintainability of the plugin should be good (code quality, following best practices)
* Documentation should be available and at least explain the purpose of the component including the most common settings.

These are the tiers in question:

Critical (Tier 1)
============================================
* Core team develops and supports
* Compiler errors or functional failures block git merges and releases
* Functionality is part of the standard installation or an officially supported plugin

Supplemental (Tier 2)
=====================================================
* Core team develops and supports or the functionality is deemed to be important enough to invest their time into bringing the plugin to its desired state in the long run.
* Compiler errors or functional failures block git merges
* Functionality problems such as 'known issues' might still go into releases
* Features require user to install the plugin / functionality not installed by default

Community (Tier 3)
============================
- Tier 3 is community supported, this means the OPNsense core development team won't support it to avoid overloading the team
- When accepting a Tier 3 feature into the code base, it will come with a number of limits and conditions:

  *  Submitter must commit to maintaining it:

    - Make sure code compiles and correctly functions after OPNsense and/or external (e.g. library) changes
    - Support users when they encounter problems (forum / git issue tracker – all related issues will be assigned to the maintainer)

- The code is offered as plugin and will not be part of the default OPNsense installation. The OPNsense core team will not be responsible for QA
- If the feature get lots of traction, and/or if the team just considers it very useful, it may get 'promoted' to being officially supported (Tier 2)
- The feature will be removed if the submitter stops maintaining it and no-one steps up to take over



Community
---------
If you need help with OPNsense you can always try the community options first.
When resorting to community support it is important to understand that anyone
helping you is doing so for free and at their own time. Even though your issue or
question may not be answered fully, it would be nice to thank the people who
help you.

To receive community support, the following options are available:

* Start searching this documentation & wiki
* The `OPNsense forum <https://forum.opnsense.org>`__
* Ask online users on `IRC Libera Chat <https://libera.chat/>`__ #opnsense
* Open a GitHub ticket (`core <https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues>`__, `plugins <https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/issues>`__) using one of our templates

.. Note::

    When a Github ticket is opened, it often is being tagged "support", but its status may change over time when more details
    are known. Triaging issues takes time, the easier one can replicate an issue on a clean install, the higher the chance
    tickets are being solved.
