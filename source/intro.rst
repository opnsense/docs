Welcome to OPNsense's documentation!
------------------------------------
`OPNsense® <https://opnsense.org>`__ is an open source,
easy-to-use and easy-to-build FreeBSD based firewall and routing platform.

**OPNsense** includes most of the features available in expensive commercial
firewalls, and more in many cases. It brings the rich feature set of commercial
offerings with the benefits of open and verifiable sources.

-----------------
Mission Statement
-----------------

  Give users, developers and businesses a friendly, stable and transparent
  environment. Make OPNsense the most widely used open source security platform.
  The project’s name is derived from open and sense and stands for:
  “Open (source) makes sense.”

Feature set
-----------

The feature set of OPNsense includes high-end features such as forward caching
proxy, traffic shaping, intrusion detection and easy OpenVPN client setup.
The latest release is based on a recent FreeBSD for long-term support and uses a
newly developed MVC-framework based on Phalcon. OPNsense’s focus on security
brings unique features such as the option to use LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL
(selectable in the GUI) and a custom version based on HardenedBSD.

The robust and reliable update mechanism gives OPNsense the ability to provide
important security updates in a timely fashion.
