Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* StrongSwan IPsec configuration now uses the preferred swanctl.conf instead of the deprecated ipsec.conf which could lead to connectivity issues in ambiguous cases.
* The new IPsec connections pages and API create an independent set of connections following the design of swanctl.conf.  Legacy tunnel settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated.
* Rate limiting was removed from the captive portal which was set to 250 connections by the same IP to the captive portal itself.  This can be easily replaced by a manual firewall rule with advanced options set, e.g.  "Max established" set to 250 with destination "This Firewall".
