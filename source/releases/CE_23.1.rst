23.1  "Quintessential Quail" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 8 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

23.1, nicknamed "Quintessential Quail", features Unbound DNS statistics with
a blocklist rewrite in Python, improved WAN SLAAC operability, firewall
alias BGP ASN type support, PHP 8.1, assorted FreeBSD networking updates,
MVC/API pages for packet capture/virtual IPs/IPsec connection management,
IPsec configuration file migration to swanctl.conf, new sslh plugin, ddclient
custom backend support (including Azure), WireGuard kernel module plugin
variant as the new default plus much more.

So this is the end of life release for the 23.1 series which includes the
recent FreeBSD advisories as well as plugin support for Zabbix 6.4.

We have finished the OpenVPN MVC "instances" for anyone who is interested in
a preview using the current development release.  FreeBSD 13.2 side looks
ready so we will be releasing 23.7-RC1 some time in the second half of July.
The final 23.7 release is scheduled for July 31.  The upgrade path from 23.1
will be enabled shortly after the new major release, but can take up to 24

23.1.10 (June 22, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


As summer is approaching we release this minor update in preparation for
the upcoming 23.7 series.  We are planning the upgrade to FreeBSD 13.2
as well as offering an MVC variant of the OpenVPN integration amongst
many other improvements some of which already shipped in previous 23.1.x

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.1.9 (May 31, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


A small update to improve stability with multiple delegated prefixes from
DHCPv6 connectivity as well as proper "no binding" handling in the DHCPv6
client itself.  Internally, the backend service has been refactored to allow
for future additions, but no visible functionality changes have been done.

Still pretty happy with the IPsec connections MVC pages introduced in 23.1 so
we would like to apply the same approach to OpenVPN for 23.7 and it is going
to land in the next development version most likely for a sneak preview.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: fix MVC service page with ID-based reload like OpenVPN
* system: fix issue with route add command for far gateway static route (contributed by Daniel Mason)
* system: improve static routes error handling
* system: fix a typo and align "attribute" use in gateway edit page
* system: pluginctl: service mode can now batch-reload services when existing ID is omitted

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.1.8 (May 25, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update improves IPv6 connectivity, extends module support for the axgbe
network driver and fixes a panic with IPv6 refragmentation over policy-based
routes amongst others.

We are currently testing FreeBSD 13.2 for the upcoming OPNsense 23.7 and it
looks promising.  Watch out for roadmap updates over the next few weeks as
more MVC page conversions are being carried out.

Here are the full patch notes:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.1.7 (May 04, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today we switch to OpenVPN 2.6 including deferred authentication which we
know some people have been waiting for.  The routing subsystem received a
refactor to integrate default gateway switching into the actual routing
code.

Suricata was finally updated to a newer release since the Netmap (IPS) stall
bug inside their code had been found and fixed while we were still using an
older code base that did not have the error.

Please also note that OpenVPN does no longer support the XOR feature due to
FreeBSD ports blocking these types of out-of-project contributions and OpenVPN
itself was never interested in supporting it natively.  We have been keeping
this alive since 2015, but several alternatives exist now that were not
available back then.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: restructure routing to carry out default gateway switching and address family specific reconfig
* system: prevent PHP session garbage collection from running early (contributed by lin-xianming)
* system: finish simplifying plugins_run()
* firewall: add missing scrub rules in dependency check for alias use
* firewall: usability improvements and cleanups in scheduler pages (contributed by kuya1284)
* interfaces: ensure single PPP netgraph node has the proper name
* interfaces: reject invalid self-assignments in VLAN parent
* interfaces: migrate trace route page to MVC/API
* interfaces: migrate port probe page to MVC/API
* interfaces: remove indirection in PPP ports handling
* interfaces: exclude a few cases from PPPoEv6 negotiation
* reporting: fix incorrect interface index in NetFlow init (contributed by Nicolas Thumann)
* dhcp: restart radvd on config changes, otherwise keep SIGHUP
* dhcp: when cleaning up static leases do not remove entries where only a MAC address is set
* firmware: update size requirements for major upgrades from command line
* firmware: embed build metadata into package annotations for use in runtime remote queries
* firmware: fix execution of version queries when not possible
* firmware: revoke 22.7 fingerprint
* openvpn: fix two widget display issues
* openvpn: use CARP INIT state the same way as BACKUP state for client start/stop
* openvpn: enable deferred authentication (sponsored by m.a.x. it)
* unbound: minor improvements to handle "Dot" endpoints ambiguity
* web proxy: allow more signs for username and password (contributed by Bi0T1N)

* ports: syslog-ng 4.1.1 `[6] <https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/releases/tag/syslog-ng-4.1.1>`__ 

A hotfix release was issued as 23.1.7_3:

* system: fix a typo in monitor script preventing filter/routes reconfiguration
* system: improve monitor alarm situation by not reloading monitors
* openvpn: force the interface down before reconfiguration to work around a probable regression



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.1.6 (April 20, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Two major improvements being shipped today are standalone core DNS
support for Bind and Dnscrypt-Proxy plugins as well as OpenVPN group
firewall alias type.  The latter makes it easier to manage distinct
policies for connected VPN users.  For more details please refer to
the documentation listed below.

The other honorable mention is the netmap work we have been doing
with Zenarmor and Klara on the FreeBSD kernel side which brings
bridge device support as well as a considerable improvement to the
emulated mode where several packet stalls and mbuf leaks have been
identified and subsequently fixed.  This should have an operational
impact on Suricata (IPS mode) and Zenarmor.  The state is much better
now but please do not hesitate to contact us about issues that you
might still be having with netmap-based packet flows as the topic is
a rather complex one.

Orange FR users be aware that your ISP now requires strict VLAN PCP
on all DHCPv4 requests so please now set 'Use VLAN priority' interface
setting for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.  The 'Option Modifiers' override
for "vlan-pcp" in DHCPv4 can be removed.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: register DNS service ports for unified use across core and plugins
* system: serialize deferred requests for web GUI restart
* system: relocate API messages to backend log target as they currently end up in captive portal logs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.1.3 (March 09, 2023)

* firmware: add stub for previously removed -f option in opnsense-version



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.1.2 (March 07, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is mainly a reliability update with fixes in assorted subsystems.
Of note is the OpenVPN authentication framework rewrite in order to take
advantage of the upcoming OpenVPN 2.6 deferred authentication feature and
the fix for DHCP renew behaviour that was reported on 23.1.

The roadmap for 23.7 was published, but at this point mainly consists of
MVC/API porting efforts for existing static pages.  While the rewrite is
not strictly necessary from a user perspective it will move us a lot closer
to our mission goal to introduce privilege separation and to provide an API
for all components.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: use singleton boot detection everywhere
* system: protect against more stray scripts on boot
* system: several shell_safe() conversions
* system: when applying auto-far default route make sure the local address is not empty
* system: refactor system_default_route() to prevent empty $gateway
* system: create system_resolver_configure() and cron job support
* system: add simple script and configd action to list current group membership (configctl auth list groups)
* system: prevent alias reload in routing reconfiguration like we do in rc.syshook monitor reload
* interfaces: protect against empty GIF host route
* interfaces: fix parsing of device names with a dot in packet capture
* interfaces: force newip calls through DHCP/PPP/OVPN on IPv4
* interfaces: force newip calls through DHCP/PPP on IPv6
* firewall: fix NAT dropdowns ignoring VIPs
* firewall: fix validation of alias names such as "A_BC"
* firewall: show all applicable floating rules when inspecting interface rules
* firewall: prevent networks from being sent to DNS resolver in update_tables.py

* firmware: remove retired LibreSSL flavour handling and annotations
* ipsec: reqid should not be provided on mobile sessions
* ipsec: validate pool names on connections page
* ipsec: allow "@" character in all other eap_id fields for new connections
* ipsec: add connection data to XMLRPC sync
* ipsec: "Dynamic gateway" (rightallowany) option should be translated to 0.0.0.0/0,::/0
* network time: remove "disable monitor" to get rid of log warnings (contributed by Dr. Uwe Meyer-Gruhl)
* openvpn: replace authentication handler to prepare for upcoming OpenVPN 2.6 with deferred authentication
* openvpn: rename -cipher option to --data-ciphers-fallback and adjust GUI accordingly

23.1.1 (February 15, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Apart from security updates for operating system and third party software
this mainly fixes issues with the initial 23.1 release.  IPsec and Unbound
components in particular receive a number of improvements being the more
prominent areas of work for this series.  Unbound also gained a SafeSearch
option and the new reporting database CPU usage should be much lower and
easier to use.

Overall we are happy with how the major release turned out and look forward
to further fixes in e.g. Netmap framework including Suricata changes for
multi-threading support which has been in the works for a long time.  OpenVPN
2.6 update and related changes are also pending at the moment.

The roadmap for 23.7 will be published soon and will again include a number
of MVC/API conversions for static components.  Statistics do indicate that we
are over 60% done with converting the code base to a modern framework as
compared to early 2015 which is now already over 8 years ago!

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: replace single exec_command() with new shell_safe() wrapper

A hotfix release was issued as 23.1.1_2:

* captive portal: remove mod_evasion use which was discontinued by lighttpd
* unbound: wait for pipe in logger (contributed by kulikov-a)

Rate limiting was removed from the captive portal which was set to 250
connections by the same IP to the captive portal itself.  This can be
easily replaced by a manual firewall rule with advanced options set, e.g.
"Max established" set to 250 with destination "This Firewall".

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* LibreSSL flavour has been discontinued.  Switch to OpenSSL flavour to proceed with the upgrade.
* StrongSwan IPsec configuration now uses the preferred swanctl.conf instead of the deprecated ipsec.conf which could lead to connectivity issues in ambiguous cases.  Subtle bugs cannot be ruled out as well so please raise an issue on GitHub to be able to investigate each case.
* The new IPsec connections pages and API create an independent set of connections following the design of swanctl.conf.  Legacy tunnel settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated.

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* LibreSSL flavour has been discontinued.  Switch to OpenSSL flavour to proceed with the upgrade.
* StrongSwan IPsec configuration now uses the preferred swanctl.conf instead of the deprecated ipsec.conf which could lead to connectivity issues in ambiguous cases.  Subtle bugs cannot be ruled out as well so please raise an issue on GitHub to be able to investigate each case.
* The new IPsec connections pages and API create an independent set of connections following the design of swanctl.conf.  Legacy tunnel settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated.
