23.1  "Quintessential Quail" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 8 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

23.1, nicknamed "Quintessential Quail", features Unbound DNS statistics with
a blocklist rewrite in Python, improved WAN SLAAC operability, firewall
alias BGP ASN type support, PHP 8.1, assorted FreeBSD networking updates,
MVC/API pages for packet capture/virtual IPs/IPsec connection management,
IPsec configuration file migration to swanctl.conf, new sslh plugin, ddclient
custom backend support (including Azure), WireGuard kernel module plugin
variant as the new default plus much more.

23.1.4 (March 21, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Another stable update to fix a StrongSwan regression and two OpenVPN
incompatibilities introduced prior.  We have also improved the service
handling code in multiple areas, fixed issues like the VIP migration

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.1.3 (March 09, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update was not planned as such, but an Sqlite compile change in FreeBSD
ports required a clean rebuild so instead of a hotfix we are shipping this tiny
stable update.

Here are the full patch notes:

* firewall: fix mismatch of options in new automatic listing of floating rules in interface rules
* ipsec: "Allow any remote gateway to connect" should suffix all in order to connect to the other end
* ipsec: store proper log values in advanced settings
* ipsec: add a routing hook and execute it for all VTI devices during reconfiguration
* ports: phpseclib 3.0.19 `[1] <https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/releases/tag/3.0.19>`__ 
* ports: sqlite backs out disabling DQS option which broke software on multiple ends
* ports: sudo 1.9.13p3 `[2] <https://www.sudo.ws/stable.html#1.9.13p3>`__ 

A hotfix release was issued as 23.1.3_4:

* firewall: fix rule display of inverted aliases
* firmware: add stub for previously removed -f option in opnsense-version



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.1.2 (March 07, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is mainly a reliability update with fixes in assorted subsystems.
Of note is the OpenVPN authentication framework rewrite in order to take
advantage of the upcoming OpenVPN 2.6 deferred authentication feature and
the fix for DHCP renew behaviour that was reported on 23.1.

The roadmap for 23.7 was published, but at this point mainly consists of
MVC/API porting efforts for existing static pages.  While the rewrite is
not strictly necessary from a user perspective it will move us a lot closer
to our mission goal to introduce privilege separation and to provide an API
for all components.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: use singleton boot detection everywhere
* system: protect against more stray scripts on boot
* system: several shell_safe() conversions
* system: when applying auto-far default route make sure the local address is not empty
* system: refactor system_default_route() to prevent empty $gateway
* system: create system_resolver_configure() and cron job support
* system: add simple script and configd action to list current group membership (configctl auth list groups)
* system: prevent alias reload in routing reconfiguration like we do in rc.syshook monitor reload
* interfaces: protect against empty GIF host route
* interfaces: fix parsing of device names with a dot in packet capture
* interfaces: force newip calls through DHCP/PPP/OVPN on IPv4
* interfaces: force newip calls through DHCP/PPP on IPv6
* firewall: fix NAT dropdowns ignoring VIPs
* firewall: fix validation of alias names such as "A_BC"
* fIrewall: show all applicable floating rules when inspecting interface rules
* firewall: prevent networks from being sent to DNS resolver in update_tables.py

* ipsec: validate pool names on connections page
* ipsec: allow "@" character in all other eap_id fields for new connections

* openvpn: replace authentication handler to prepare for upcoming OpenVPN 2.6 with deferred authentication
* openvpn: rename -cipher option to --data-ciphers-fallback and adjust GUI accordingly

23.1.1 (February 15, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Apart from security updates for operating system and third party software
this mainly fixes issues with the initial 23.1 release.  IPsec and Unbound
components in particular receive a number of improvements being the more
prominent areas of work for this series.  Unbound also gained a SafeSearch
option and the new reporting database CPU usage should be much lower and
easier to use.

Overall we are happy with how the major release turned out and look forward
to further fixes in e.g. Netmap framework including Suricata changes for
multi-threading support which has been in the works for a long time.  OpenVPN
2.6 update and related changes are also pending at the moment.

The roadmap for 23.7 will be published soon and will again include a number
of MVC/API conversions for static components.  Statistics do indicate that we
are over 60% done with converting the code base to a modern framework as
compared to early 2015 which is now already over 8 years ago!

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: replace single exec_command() with new shell_safe() wrapper

A hotfix release was issued as 23.1.1_2:

* captive portal: remove mod_evasion use which was discontinued by lighttpd
* unbound: wait for pipe in logger (contributed by kulikov-a)

Rate limiting was removed from the captive portal which was set to 250
connections by the same IP to the captive portal itself.  This can be
easily replaced by a manual firewall rule with advanced options set, e.g.
"Max established" set to 250 with destination "This Firewall".

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* LibreSSL flavour has been discontinued.  Switch to OpenSSL flavour to proceed with the upgrade.
* StrongSwan IPsec configuration now uses the preferred swanctl.conf instead of the deprecated ipsec.conf which could lead to connectivity issues in ambiguous cases.  Subtle bugs cannot be ruled out as well so please raise an issue on GitHub to be able to investigate each case.
* The new IPsec connections pages and API create an independent set of connections following the design of swanctl.conf.  Legacy tunnel settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated.

23.1.r1 (January 13, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 8 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.  <3

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* LibreSSL flavour has been discontinued.  Switch to OpenSSL flavour to proceed with the upgrade.
* StrongSwan IPsec configuration now uses the preferred swanctl.conf instead of the deprecated ipsec.conf which could lead to connectivity issues in ambiguous cases.  Subtle bugs cannot be ruled out as well so please raise an issue on GitHub to be able to investigate each case.
* The new IPsec connections pages and API create an independent set of connections following the design of swanctl.conf.  Legacy tunnel settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated.
