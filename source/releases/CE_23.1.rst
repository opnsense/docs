23.1  "Quintessential Quail" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 8 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

23.1, nicknamed "Quintessential Quail", features Unbound DNS statistics with
a blocklist rewrite in Python, improved WAN SLAAC operability, firewall
alias BGP ASN type support, PHP 8.1, assorted FreeBSD networking updates,
MVC/API pages for packet capture/virtual IPs/IPsec connection management,
IPsec configuration file migration to swanctl.conf, new sslh plugin, ddclient
custom backend support (including Azure), WireGuard kernel module plugin
variant as the new default plus much more.

23.1.1 (February 15, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Apart from security updates for operating system and third party software
this mainly fixes issues with the initial 23.1 release.  IPsec and Unbound
components in particular receive a number of improvements being the more
prominent areas of work for this series.  Unbound also gained a SafeSearch
option and the new reporting database CPU usage should be much lower and
easier to use.

Overall we are happy with how the major release turned out and look forward
to further fixes in e.g. Netmap framework including Suricata changes for
multi-threading support which has been in the works for a long time.  OpenVPN
2.6 update and related changes are also pending at the moment.

The roadmap for 23.7 will be published soon and will again include a number
of MVC/API conversions for static components.  Statistics do indicate that we
are over 60% done with converting the code base to a modern framework as
compared to early 2015 which is now already over 8 years ago!

A hotfix release was issued as 23.1.1_2:

* captive portal: remove mod_evasion use which was discontinued by lighttpd
* unbound: wait for pipe in logger (contributed by kulikov-a)

Rate limiting was removed from the captive portal which was set to 250
connections by the same IP to the captive portal itself.  This can be
easily replaced by a manual firewall rule with advanced options set, e.g.
"Max established" set to 250 with destination "This Firewall".

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* LibreSSL flavour has been discontinued.  Switch to OpenSSL flavour to proceed with the upgrade.
* StrongSwan IPsec configuration now uses the preferred swanctl.conf instead of the deprecated ipsec.conf which could lead to connectivity issues in ambiguous cases.  Subtle bugs cannot be ruled out as well so please raise an issue on GitHub to be able to investigate each case.
* The new IPsec connections pages and API create an independent set of connections following the design of swanctl.conf.  Legacy tunnel settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated.
