===========================================================================================
23.7  "Restless Roadrunner" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 8 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

23.7, nicknamed "Restless Roadrunner", features numerous MVC/API conversions
including the new OpenVPN "instances" configuration option, OpenVPN group
alias support, deferred authentication for OpenVPN, FreeBSD 13.2, PHP 8.2
plus much more.

23.7.9 (November 23, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


As the end of the year inches closer the changes published today are naturally
smaller additions and cleanups, notably changes for IPsec VTI connection for
IPv6 and dual-stack operation, a possible OpenVPN CSO mismatch bug and optional
support for SHA-512 password hashing.

Note that the HTTPS bump for the firmware mirrors updates the published URLs
in the firmware selection, but if you already use LeaseWeb or NYC BUG you need
to reselect them in order to move from HTTP to HTTPS connectivity.

Of further note is that the Squid web proxy will be moved to a plugin in
version 24.1 but for everyone using it the upgrade procedure will make sure
to install it automatically when enabled.  A meta package was added to the
plugins already in order for this to work just in case there are questions
about what it is supposed to be doing... apart from providing dependencies
it does not do anything at the moment.  ;)

Last but not least, we have been successfully testing and ironing out OpenSSL
3 ports builds in the past week and inclusion in 24.1 seems very likely at this
point.  The effort continues and we will also be looking into backport material
from FreeBSD 13 stable branches for further preparation.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: add SHA-512 password hash compliance option
* system: allow special selector for plugins_configure()

23.7.8 (November 09, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The configuration restore GUI has been improved in a number of ways due to
recent demand and Squid was updated to the new major release version 6.

A number of reliability improvements were also added to the WireGuard
kernel plugin which from our perspective is now ready for core inclusion.
The documentation is being updated accordingly, but will take a bit more
time to ensure consistency following up on the GUI changes it received.

This update also includes FreeBSD security advisories and assorted fixes.
We are aware of OpenSSL 1.1.1 CVE-2023-5678 and we are already testing
builds based on OpenSSL 3 which can be available in 24.1 when it does not
negatively impact overall operation.  We also expect fixes for version
1 to be available sooner, but without OpenSSL providing such fixes directly
the roundtrip time is likely going to increase for them.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: minor changes related to recent Gateway class refactoring
* system: use unified style for "return preg_match" idiom so the caller receives a boolean
* system: provide mismatching interface logic without reboot on configuration restore
* system: allow new backup API to download latest configuration directly via /api/core/backup/download/this
* system: extend restore to be able to migrate older configurations cleanly
* system: make trust store reload conditional
* interfaces: assorted bridge handling improvements
* interfaces: ignore ULAs for primary IPv6 detection
* interfaces: improve wireless channel parsing
* firewall: keep filtered items available longer in live log
* firewall: when migrating aliases make sure that nesting does not fail
* firewall: port can be zero in automatic rule so render it accordingly
* firewall: minor update to shaper model
* firmware: invalidate GUI caches earlier since certctl blocks this longer now
* firmware: add root file system to health audit
* monit: minor update to model
* lang: update Chinese, Czech, Italian, Korean, Polish and Spanish
* openvpn: host bits must not be set for IPv4 server directive in instances
* unbound: minor update to model
* unbound: remove localhost from automatically created ACL
* web proxy: handle the major update to version 6 and update model
* mvc: enforce uniqueness and remove validation message in UnqiueIdField
* mvc: config should be locked before calling checkAndThrowSafeDelete()

23.7.7 (October 25, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The user experience of several pages has been improved.  And this update is
also shipping several FreeBSD-based changes for further reliability as well
as core fixes and improvements as they came up on GitHub or the forum in the
last weeks.

A word of caution for third party repository users.  FreeBSD currently changes
a number of things in their ecosystem.  The first change is the move of the
"openssl" package to "openssl111" since the former is now based on version 3.
This can and likely will disrupt updates of third party packages not having
followed this change.  While we want to use OpenSSL 3 eventually being in
the middle of a stable run is not the time and place to do it.  Secondly,
FreeBSD makes its port stop relying on ca_root_nss package trust store
provided by Mozilla which introduces technical barriers for integration of
our own trust store.  This update changes curl to not use the old bundle
files, but then also ensures that the base system will register all CA
certificates brought in by our trust store as well.  The biggest caveat at
the moment is that this process is slower than before and may end up
untrusting user CAs if they happen to be on the FreeBSD-provided untrusted
list.  During upgrades you will see when it writes the trust files and bundles
and if any errors occur.

In both instances we feel nothing can be gained in postponing these changes
so we are carrying them out swiftly after ensuring they do the right thing for
our user base and voicing our reservations where it matters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.7.6 (October 11, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update is a maintenance release improving the DS-Lite use via separate
GIF tunnels on top of IPv6-only connectivity.  We are still continuing the
efforts to provide better MVC integration for the gateways abstraction as
well as working towards better MVC model consistency.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.7.5 (September 26, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today introduces a change in MTU handling for parent interfaces mostly
noticed by PPPoE use where the respective MTU values need to fit the
parent plus the additional header of the VLAN or PPPoE.  Should the
MTU already be misconfigured to a smaller value it will be used as
configured so check your configuration and clear the MTU value if you
want the system to decide about the effective parent MTU size.

Another change in far gateway handling is also included which prevents
a monitoring failure if that particular gateway was not being designated
as default during boot which made the routing table miss the essential
interface route and monitoring would always report it as down.  Now the
interface route is ensured but not only when applying the default gateway
so that it works all the time.

Also fixed was the problematic migration of the Unbound interfaces settings
which now clears the possibly unknown interfaces in order to proceed and
have Unbound up and running post update which was not the case for some
users previously.

Other reliability improvements and third party security updates are
included as well.  We also continue our effort to clean up the interface
handling code and audit the MVC model files for consistency.  A missing
change for out of the box DS-Lite support is also being tested on the
development version now and will likely hit in 23.7.6.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: pluginctl: allow -f mode to drop config properties
* system: switch to /usr/sbin/nologin as authoritative command location
* system: remove remaining spurious ifconfig data pass to Gateways class
* system: fix data cleansing issue in "column_count" and "sequence" values on dashboard

23.7.4 (September 14, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The usual amount of improvements go out today with FreeBSD security
advisories on top.  The new Python version was also picked up.

23.7.3 (August 30, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Recently we improved the workflow for bringing language updates to the
release so here we are with an updated translation package including
added support for Korean.  Thanks a lot to all contributors for keeping
this going strong!

If you would like to help with translations you can sign up via:

https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=179921

Of note is also the largely rewritten backend for the WireGuard kernel
module plugin which offers separate services for each instance much
like OpenVPN offers it.  The requirement of the wireguard-tools and bash
packages were removed.  This also means the plugin will be moved to the
core for 24.1 along with Wireguard go plugin being removed completely
since on FreeBSD 13.2 no external package is needed to enjoy WireGuard
and the permanent existence of a kernel module renders the Go fallback
defunct through wireguard-tools/wg-quick implementation quirks.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: fix missing config save when RRD data is supplied during backup import
* system: defer config reload to SIGHUP in gateway watcher
* system: handle "force_down" state correctly in gateway watcher

23.7 (July 31, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 8 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

23.7, nicknamed "Restless Roadrunner", features numerous MVC/API conversions
including the new OpenVPN "instances" configuration option, OpenVPN group
alias support, deferred authentication for OpenVPN, FreeBSD 13.2, PHP 8.2
plus much more.

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The Unbound ACL now defaults to accept all traffic and no longer generates automatic entries.  This was done to avoid connectivity issues on dynamic address setups -- especially with VPN interfaces.  If this is undesirable you can set it to default to block instead and add your manual entries to pass.
* Dpinger no longer triggers alarms on its own as its mechanism is too simplistic for loss and delay detection as provided by apinger a long time ago.  Delay and loss triggers have been fixed and logging was improved.  The rc.syshook facility "monitor" still exists but is only provided for compatibility reasons with existing user scripts.
* IPsec "tunnel settings" GUI is now deprecated and manual migration to the "connections" GUI is recommended.  An appropriate EoL announcement will be made next year.
* The new OpenVPN instances pages and API create an independent set of instances more closely following the upstream documentation of OpenVPN.  Legacy client/server settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated, but will continue to work independently.
* The old DynDNS plugin was removed in favor of the newer MVC/API plugin for ddclient.  We are aware of the EoL state of ddclient which was unfortunately announced only one year after we started working on the new plugin.  We will try to add upstream fixes that have not been released yet and already offer our own ddclient-less Python backend in the same plugin as an alternative.

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The Unbound ACL now defaults to accept all traffic and no longer generates automatic entries.  This was done to avoid connectivity issues on dynamic address setups -- especially with VPN interfaces.  If this is undesirable you can set it to default to block instead and add your manual entries to pass.
* Dpinger no longer triggers alarms on its own as its mechanism is too simplistic for loss and delay detection as provided by apinger a long time ago.  Delay and loss triggers have been fixed and logging was improved.  The rc.syshook facility "monitor" still exists but is only provided for compatibility reasons with existing user scripts.
* IPsec "tunnel settings" GUI is now deprecated and manual migration to the "connections" GUI is recommended.  An appropriate EoL announcement will be made next year.
* The new OpenVPN instances pages and API create an independent set of instances more closely following the upstream documentation of OpenVPN.  Legacy client/server settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated, but will continue to work independently.
* The old DynDNS plugin was removed in favor of the newer MVC/API plugin for ddclient.  We are aware of the EoL state of ddclient which was unfortunately announced only one year after we started working on the new plugin.  We will try to add upstream fixes that have not been released yet and already offer our own ddclient-less Python backend in the same plugin as an alternative.
