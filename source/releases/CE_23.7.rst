23.7  "Restless Roadrunner" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 8 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

23.7, nicknamed "Restless Roadrunner", features numerous MVC/API conversions
including the new OpenVPN "instances" configuration option, OpenVPN group
alias support, deferred authentication for OpenVPN, FreeBSD 13.2, PHP 8.2
plus much more.

23.7.5 (September 26, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today introduces a change in MTU handling for parent interfaces mostly
noticed by PPPoE use where the respective MTU values need to fit the
parent plus the additional header of the VLAN or PPPoE.  Should the
MTU already be misconfigured to a smaller value it will be used as
configured so check your configuration and clear the MTU value if you
want the system to decide about the effective parent MTU size.

Another change in far gateway handling is also included which prevents
a monitoring failure if that particular gateway was not being designated
as default during boot which made the routing table miss the essential
interface route and monitoring would always report it as down.  Now the
interface route is ensured but not only when applying the default gateway
so that it works all the time.

Also fixed was the problematic migration of the Unbound interfaces settings
which now clears the possibly unknown interfaces in order to proceed and
have Unbound up and running post update which was not the case for some
users previously.

Other reliability improvements and third party security updates are
included as well.  We also continue our effort to clean up the interface
handling code and audit the MVC model files for consistency.  A missing
change for out of the box DS-Lite support is also being tested on the
development version now and will likely hit in 23.7.6.

23.7.4 (September 14, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The usual amount of improvements go out today with FreeBSD security
advisories on top.  The new Python version was also picked up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.7.3 (August 30, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Recently we improved the workflow for bringing language updates to the
release so here we are with an updated translation package including
added support for Korean.  Thanks a lot to all contributors for keeping
this going strong!

If you would like to help with translations you can sign up via:

https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=179921

Of note is also the largely rewritten backend for the WireGuard kernel
module plugin which offers separate services for each instance much
like OpenVPN offers it.  The requirement of the wireguard-tools and bash
packages were removed.  This also means the plugin will be moved to the
core for 24.1 along with Wireguard go plugin being removed completely
since on FreeBSD 13.2 no external package is needed to enjoy WireGuard
and the permanent existence of a kernel module renders the Go fallback
defunct through wireguard-tools/wg-quick implementation quirks.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: fix missing config save when RRD data is supplied during backup import
* system: defer config reload to SIGHUP in gateway watcher
* system: handle "force_down" state correctly in gateway watcher
* system: make Gateways class argument optional
* interfaces: tweak UX of interface settings page

* openvpn: fix mismatch issue when pinning a CSO to a specific instance
* openvpn: add advanced option for optional CA selection
* unbound: fix concurrent session closing the handle while still writing data in Python module
* web proxy: remove long deprecated "dns_v4_first" setting from GUI
* mvc: extend PortField to optionally allow port type aliases
* lang: update all languages and add Korean
* plugins: os-firewall 1.4 adds port alias support

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The Unbound ACL now defaults to accept all traffic and no longer generates automatic entries.  This was done to avoid connectivity issues on dynamic address setups -- especially with VPN interfaces.  If this is undesirable you can set it to default to block instead and add your manual entries to pass.
* Dpinger no longer triggers alarms on its own as its mechanism is too simplistic for loss and delay detection as provided by apinger a long time ago.  Delay and loss triggers have been fixed and logging was improved.  The rc.syshook facility "monitor" still exists but is only provided for compatibility reasons with existing user scripts.
* IPsec "tunnel settings" GUI is now deprecated and manual migration to the "connections" GUI is recommended.  An appropriate EoL announcement will be made next year.
* The new OpenVPN instances pages and API create an independent set of instances more closely following the upstream documentation of OpenVPN.  Legacy client/server settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated, but will continue to work independently.
* The old DynDNS plugin was removed in favor of the newer MVC/API plugin for ddclient.  We are aware of the EoL state of ddclient which was unfortunately announced only one year after we started working on the new plugin.  We will try to add upstream fixes that have not been released yet and already offer our own ddclient-less Python backend in the same plugin as an alternative.

For more than 8 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.  <3

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The Unbound ACL now defaults to accept all traffic and no longer generates automatic entries.  This was done to avoid connectivity issues on dynamic address setups -- especially with VPN interfaces.  If this is undesirable you can set it to default to block instead and add your manual entries to pass.
* Dpinger no longer triggers alarms on its own as its mechanism is too simplistic for loss and delay detection as provided by apinger a long time ago.  Delay and loss triggers have been fixed and logging was improved.  The rc.syshook facility "monitor" still exists but is only provided for compatibility reasons with existing user scripts.
* IPsec "tunnel settings" GUI is now deprecated and manual migration to the "connections" GUI is recommended.  An appropriate EoL announcement will be made next year.
* The new OpenVPN instances pages and API create an independent set of instances more closely following the upstream documentation of OpenVPN.  Legacy client/server settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated, but will continue to work independently.
* The old DynDNS plugin was removed in favor of the newer MVC/API plugin for ddclient.  We are aware of the EoL state of ddclient which was unfortunately announced only one year after we started working on the new plugin.  We will try to add upstream fixes that have not been released yet and already offer our own ddclient-less Python backend in the same plugin as an alternative.
