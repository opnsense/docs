17.1  "Eclectic Eagle" Series
===========================================================================================



The OPNsense team is proud to announce the final availability of version
17.1, nicknamed "Eclectic Eagle".  This major release features FreeBSD 11.0,
the SSH remote installer, new languages Italian / Czech / Portuguese,
state-of-the-art HardenedBSD security features, PHP 7.0, new plugins for
FTP Proxy / Tinc VPN / Let's Encrypt, native PAM authentication against e.g.
2FA (TOTP), as well a rewritten Nano-style card images that adapt to media
size to name only a few.

We would like to encourage everyone to supervise this major upgrade
physically.  As such, it cannot be performed from the GUI.  Instead, go
to the root console menu, choose option 12 and type "17.1" at the prompt.
The process will download a full set of updates and reboot multiple times.
All operating system files and packages will be reinstalled as a consequence.
This process can also be remotely triggered via SSH.

For fresh installations images are provided with OpenSSL for 32 and 64 bit
Intel architectures.  The new SSH installer feature will be listening on the
LAN port 192.168.1.1, give out DHCP leases to clients and can connect using
the user "root" (console menu) or "installer" (the installer, of course) with
the default password "opnsense".  The respective checksums for the images can
be found below this announcement and the direct download links from our
capable mirror providers are as follows:

17.1.11 (July 25, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


An IPv6 problem has finally been fixed which could prevent reclaiming
address leases during an interface reload, especially when OpenVPN was
running.  Thanks to everyone involved in tracking this down!  Also,
the last bits for the new GUI major upgrade feature are now in place.
The 17.7 upgrade path will be unlocked on July 31, which will require
installing one tiny final update.

Here are the full patch notes:

* firmware: added major GUI upgrade code for upcoming 17.7 release
* firmware: added major GUI cron upgrade parameter "ALLOW_RISKY_MAJOR_UPGRADE"
* interfaces: dhcp6c can now properly reload without leaking its
  listening socket to e.g. OpenVPN
* rc: allow to optionally prevent launch of configd via rc.conf variable
* openvpn: normalise line endings of used certificates
* openvpn: fix config handling in GUI pages for PHP 7.1
* plugins: os-quagga 1.3.2 (contributed by Fabian Franz and Michael Muenz)

17.1.9 (July 04, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Quite the list of changes after a few weeks of a turbulent summer.  This
update addresses Stack Clash, OpenVPN, Bind and cURL security issues, see
the reference links below.

17.7 is almost here, which means we have skipped over Alpha and Beta phase
due to the fact that the base system is staying on FreeBSD 11.0.  What you
can expect is a Release Candidate within a week and a smooth transition.

17.1.8 (June 01, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It is with pleasure that we announce the availability of SafeStack in
the OPNsense ports tree as our latest addition via our valued HardenendBSD
friendship.  While SafeStack is already deployed for the base operating
system, it had not previously been applied to the ports tree.

SafeStack is an exploit mitigation developed by clang/llvm.  It helps
mitigate stack-based buffer overflows.  SafeStack depends on Address
Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in order to be effective.  OPNsense
fulfils that dependency by including the HardenedBSD ASLR implementation,
which follows the original PaX design.  Without ASLR, SafeStack is
ineffective as an attacker would know where the SafeStack lies in
memory and could use that information to her advantage.

It is still rather quiet security-wise.  Despite updating OpenSSL,
it does not contain any security updates this time.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: tweak the HTTP_REFERER error message (contributed by Michael Muenz)
* system: IPv6 SSL cipher selection fix (contributed by Alexander Graf)
* system: only probe gateway monitor when it is running
* system: move web GUI to plugin framework
* system: improve ssh key newline write

* firewall: add CARP option "Disable preempt"
* firewall: move CARP preempt to later boot stage
* firewall: allow port ranges in the form of "80-100" in addition to "80:100"

* ipsec: fix widget count after strongSwan 5.5.2 update
* intrusion detection: add advanced feature default-packet-size
* firmware: new mirror for Dept. of CSE, Yuan Ze University, Taiwan `[1] <https://www.cse.yzu.edu.tw>`__ 
* rc: advertise live mode just above the login prompt
* rc: improve the set IP menu option with far gateway selection,
  DHCP, DNS, track6, etc.
* mvc: send forms as type-safe JSON data
* mvc: correct multi-value sort in template helper
* mvc: fix validation issue when storing a value for the first time
* lang: minor updates for Chinese (contributed by Tianmo)

* plugins: quagga 1.2 with initial BGP support (contributed by
  Fabian Franz and Michael Muenz)
* plugins: zabbix-agent 1.0 (contributed by Frank Wall)
* plugins: haproxy 1.15 (contributed by Fabian Franz and Frank Wall)
* ports: enabled SafeStack for applicable amd64 packages, ported
  over by HardenedBSD
* ports: openssl 1.0.2l `[2] <https://www.openssl.org/news/cl102.txt>`__

17.1.7 (May 18, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


OpenVPN released version 2.4.2 and also 2.3.15 which come with two high
profile fixes addressing CVE-2017-7479 and CVE-2017-7478.  While we still
aim for OpenVPN 2.4 adoption during the 17.1 series, we have deferred

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.1.6 (May 04, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Other than the usual bulk of improvements, the Quagga plugin gained BGP
support and the Phalcon framework is now able to run smoothly on PHP 7.1,
which we are targeting for 17.7.  The next bit of planned work in the 17.1
series is switching OpenVPN to version 2.4.  It can already be previewed
in the development version.

17.1.5 (April 24, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


After a brief timeout due to a super happy image release, 17.1.5 brings to
you several longterm improvements for the firewall handling, dynamic DNS
and several plugin updates, with Quagga and Monit as two brand new additions
to the pool.  As an especially longterm improvement, the German translation
finally hit 100% completed thanks to the many contributors over the last
two years.

We are currently working on extending SafeStack support to mission-critical
third-party packages, testing the move to PHP 7.1 and finishing the
associated roadmap for the upcoming 17.7 release.  Stay tuned for more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.1.4 (March 29, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The update finally addresses one of the larger issues with IPsec in
17.1 where traffic was not properly tracked by the packet filter and
therefore causing spurious connection drops in TCP sessions.  Another
cool addition is the merge of the HardenedBSD SafeStack work to
further harden our operating system application binaries.

Last but not least, the switch to the new virtual terminal driver
is now fully functional and we intend to release new images based
on 17.1.4 on Monday next week.  Note this does not affect running
installations.

Upgrading from a physical console may abort the firmware update due
to an incompatible switch in the TTY settings.  Simply log in again
and restart the update to continue.  Note this does not affect
upgrades via GUI or SSH.  Should problems arise, force a reinstall
of the core package from the shell with the following command:

.. code-block::

    # opnsense-revert opnsense

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: early installer switched for simpler config importer
* system: no longer set shell privileges on password reset
* system: avoid misinterpreting obsoleted options use_mfs_tmp_size
  and use_mfs_var_size
* system: do not prompt for password on user edit
* system: modernise console/tty settings
* interfaces: always wait for dhclient exit
* firewall: handle scheduled restarts via new plugin_cron() facility
* traffic shaper: exclude IP address when using 3G/4G modems
* dnsmasq: configure exclusively via plugin calls
* ipsec: remove filtertunnel workaround in light of bundled kernel fix
* ipsec: fix missing CA selection for mutual RSA
* ipsec: require authentication header as first file
* ipsec: include path consolidation
* openvpn: allow tunnel network overrides to contain host addresses
* openvpn: take client IP for topology subnet in CSC
* openvpn: include patch consolidation
* unbound: configure exclusively via plugin calls
* web proxy: harden SSL ciphers (contributed by Fabian Franz)
* mvc: fix multiple scoping issues in base volt templates

* src: fix IPsec skip parameter handling in IPv4
* src: discard 3072 bytes in arc4_stir() (contributed by Codarren Velvindron)
* ports: ca_root_nss 3.30
* ports: php 7.0.17 `[6] <https://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.0.17>`__ 
* ports: libarchive 3.3.1
* ports: ntp 4.2.8p10 `[7] <https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ntp_spool/ntp4/ChangeLog-stable>`__ 

We are also happy to announce the availability of the renewed OPNsense 17.1
images based on this version.  Apart from the numerous improvements since
the initial release, the images have been switched to use the virtual
console driver vt(4) as a default to address boot issues.  They also feature
a new config importer and fix the serial console display of the installer.

For more than two years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the code base, quick and reliable firmware
upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption of upstream software
updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

Download links, an installation guide `[8] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html>`__  and the checksums for the images

17.1.3 (March 16, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


A dozen bug fixes meet several dozen new features and enhancements,
literally!  This update is about making OPNsense more flexible with
the tools that everybody knows: firewall management, DNS services and
Let's Encrypt.

This is also the stepping stone for providing new images based on 17.1
because the Hyper-V disk disappearance was now fixed upstream: a big
thank you to Microsoft and FreeBSD for providing updates!  The vt(4)
console driver migration is still underway, as well as applying
SafeStack for the amd64 architecture and chasing down an IPsec
regression with FreeBSD 11.0.  More on this next time, stay tuned.

17.1.2 (February 22, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update addresses a longstanding issue with the overall reliability
of Realtek NICs by replacing the FreeBSD driver with its latest vendor
driver equivalent.  The results including inline intrusion prevention
have been promising to say the least.  We thank Realtek for its recent
release of version 1.93 and our users for pursuing the unthinkable with
us.  :)

Speaking of intrusion prevention, Suricata and Hyperscan have been
updated to their latest versions which will now prevent crashes with
older 64 bit CPUs that do not have the SSSE3 instruction set.

Language updates have been plenty, with a new and very busy contributor
for Chinese.  Xie xie!

Furthermore, the shared forwarding between both packet filters introduced
in OPNsense 17.1 has now been disabled by default and can be manually
reenabled from the GUI on Firewall: Settings: Advanced.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: allow to issue reboots via cron
* system: allow to change password for imported users
* firmware: run autoremove on minor operations
* firmware: plugin detection via configd
* wizard: rework modelling and UX
* interfaces: fix wlan probe to not yield an empty interface

17.1.1 (February 09, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This week we are introducing a number of reliability fixes especially with
regard to our move to FreeBSD 11.0 and PHP 7.0; most prominently a NAT fix
for the shared filter forwarding and repairing the CRL generation.  You will
also find a few interesting IPsec additions.  ;)

In case the shared forwarding is still giving you trouble on 17.1.1, run
the following command to use the old behaviour and report back to us:

.. code-block::

    # sysctl net.pf.share_forward=0

17.1 (January 31, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The OPNsense team is proud to announce the final availability of version
17.1, nicknamed "Eclectic Eagle".  This major release features FreeBSD 11.0,
the SSH remote installer, new languages Italian / Czech / Portuguese,
state-of-the-art HardenedBSD security features, PHP 7.0, new plugins for
FTP Proxy / Tinc VPN / Let's Encrypt, native PAM authentication against e.g.
2FA (TOTP), as well a rewritten Nano-style card images that adapt to media
size to name only a few.

We would like to encourage everyone to supervise this major upgrade
physically.  As such, it cannot be performed from the GUI.  Instead, go
to the root console menu, choose option 12 and type "17.1" at the prompt.
The process will download a full set of updates and reboot multiple times.
All operating system files and packages will be reinstalled as a consequence.
This process can also be remotely triggered via SSH.

For fresh installations images are provided with OpenSSL for 32 and 64 bit
Intel architectures.  The new SSH installer feature will be listening on the
LAN port 192.168.1.1, give out DHCP leases to clients and can connect using
the user "root" (console menu) or "installer" (the installer, of course) with
the default password "opnsense".  The respective checksums for the images can
be found below this announcement and the direct download links from our
capable mirror providers are as follows:

https://opnsense.c0urier.net/releases/17.1/ (Europe)
http://mirrors.nycbug.org/pub/opnsense/releases/17.1/ (US East Coast)
http://mirror.sfo12.us.leaseweb.net/opnsense/releases/17.1/ (US West Coast)

https://opnsense.org/download/ (full mirror list)

Here is the list of major features that have been worked on since 16.7 was
released 6 months ago:

* cooperative firewall forwarding to allow traffic shaper/captive portal
  with multi-WAN
* install media now boots up with SSH for headless remote installation
* HardenedBSD ASLR and PIE compilation for most binaries
* HardenedBSD SEGVGUARD to prevent ASLR brute force attacks
* PHP 7.0 compatibility and general GUI speed improvements
* replaced the CSRF implementation in the non-MVC pages
* integrated authentication using PAM to allow e.g. 2FA (TOTP) over SSH
* system secondary console support with new EFI and Mute options
* Portuguese/Portugal as a release language (contributed by Carlos Meireles)
* Portuguese/Brazil as a release language (contributed by Thiago Basilio)
* Italian as a release language (contributed by Antonio Prado)
* Czech as a release language (contributed by Pavel Borecki)
* improved password security (contributed by OSnet)
* FTP proxy plugin (contributed by Frank Brendel)
* Let's Encrypt Plugin `[1] <https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/pull/66>`__  (contributed by Frank Wall)
* Tinc VPN Plugin
* IPsec tunnel isolation mode for interoperability
* micro versioning/migrations for config items
* constraint support for config items
* rewritten Nano images with growfs(8) support
* authentication methods are now fully pluggable
* firewall rules are now fully pluggable
* FreeBSD 11.0 including additional reliability fixes

Minor changes made since 16.7.14/17.1.r1:

* system: always restore native /var layout on boot
* system: make vt/sc configurable
* web proxy: improve validation for SSL bump URL input
  (contributed by Fabian Franz)
* web proxy: add plugin-capable pre/post authentication directories
  (contributed by Evgeny Bevz)
* mvc: use empty string instead of "##Unlinked" in missing elements
  (contributed by Frank Wall)
* www: replace CSRF implementation of static PHP pages
* src: convert result of hash_packet6() into host byte order
* src: correctly initialise subrulenr in pflog
* ports: openssl 1.0.2k `[2] <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20170126.txt>`__ 
* ports: php 7.0.15 `[3] <https://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.0.15>`__ 

Additionally, these migration caveats should be heeded before upgrading:

* The integrated authentication framework is now used as a system-wide
  default including login(1), su(1) and sudo(8).  This means that e.g. when
  2FA is enabled for the GUI it will be used for low-level password prompts
  as well and plain passwords are disabled by default.  If this behaviour is
  undesired, set the "Disable integrated authentication" option under System:
  Settings: Administration.
* Disabled Gateway entries are now always honoured instead of being set up
  as a default gateway.
* The console settings received a non-backwards compatible change.  If the
  VGA console is not working, simply reconfigure it from System: Settings:
  Administration as it was likely set to "Serial" due to a wrong GUI default.
* FreeBSD 11.0 switched to the vt(4) console driver, but we are keeping sc(4)
  as the default.  You can change this after installation by enabling the
  virtual terminal driver under System: Settings: Administration.
* EFI boots may not yield a console anymore, the setting for VGA is wrong
  now and should be switched to "EFI" under System: Settings: Administration.
* The access privileges for "Lobby: Login / Logout / Dashboard" and
  "Diagnostics: Backup / Restore" have been remapped internally and
  need to be reapplied when they have been assigned explicitly.
* The inherited 6rd kernel patches are not included in standard FreeBSD 11.0.
  The state of 6rd is possibly broken.  We ask for volunteers to pick up the
  work if 6rd is still a requirement, as we do not have access to such setups.
* Fundamental WiFi stack changes in FreeBSD 11.0 could still affect overall
  operability.  Please let us know about these right away.
* The following services moved to individual plugins and need to be reinstalled
  in order to be used: SNMP, Load Balancer, Wake on LAN, Universal Plug and
  Play, IGMP Proxy.  Their respective configurations will be preserved by the
  system even if these plugins are not installed.
* The Intel e1000 driver plugin has been removed due to an incompatibility
  with FreeBSD 11.0.  All previously known bugs of the FreeBSD 11.0 e1000
  driver have been fixed in OPNsense 17.1 and reported to FreeBSD.

17.1.r1 (January 20, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The wish list for our kernel improvements has been emptied just a
week ago, which makes 17.1-RC1 look like the final 17.1 for all
intents and purposes and already includes the stable upgrade path.
Several features have been moved from the core to the plugins and
may need to be reinstalled, namely Load Balancer, Wake on LAN, SNMP,
IGMP Proxy and Universal Plug and Play.  More details are listed below.

A special thank you goes to Carlos Meireles and Thiago Basilio, who
brought to you Portuguese as a language choice (Portugal and Brazil,
respectively).  Awesome work!

Direct download links from our capable mirror providers (checksums
below this announcement) are as follows:

If you have been running 17.1-BETA and want to switch to the stable
upgrade path simply upgrade to 17.1-RC1 and run the following from
the shell:

.. code-block::

    # # opnsense-update -t opnsense

Here is the full list of changes since 17.1-BETA:

* core: default to integrated authentication (PAM) for su, login et al

* src: IP cooperative forwarding rework, fixes IPv4 in pf
* src: avoid deadlocks during lagg configuration
* src: multiple fixes for netmap to repair emulation panics

Known issues in this version:

* The inherited 6rd kernel patches are not included in standard
  FreeBSD 11.0.  The impact on 6rd setups is currently unknown.
* Fundamental WiFi stack changes in FreeBDS 11.0 could still
  affect operability.
* Insight and Health statistics import from the early installer may not work.
* Due to a Python 2.7.13 incompatibility the NetFlow connector
  may not work.  A workaround is to revert to the Python 2.7.12
  release.  See the forum for details `[1] <https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=4235.0>`__ .
* The LibreSSL version will not be available until the final release.
* The console settings received a non-backwards compatible change.
  If the VGA console is not working, simply reconfigure it from
  System: Settings: Administration as it was likely set to Serial

17.1.b (December 16, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


With the best wishes for the holiday season attached we hereby humbly
present our 17.1-BETA images and thank everyone for their early input,
valid questions and generally keeping us on our toes throughout the
past months.  The next major release features FreeBSD 11.0, the SSH
remote installer, new languages Italian and Czech, state-of-the-art
HardenedBSD security features, PHP 7.0, native PAM authentication
against e.g. 2FA (TOTP), as well a rewritten Nano-style card images
that adapt to the media size to name only a few.

These will be the only beta images.  They are not suitable for production
environments.  Release candidate builds will start in January in order
to provide production-ready images.  Checksums can be found below this
announcement.  Direct download links from our capable mirror providers
are as follows:

Here is a list of hand-picked major features that were worked on since 16.7:

* system secondary console support with new EFI and Mute options
* installer now boots up with SSH for headless remote installation
* Italian as a release language (contributed by Antonio Prado)
* Czech as a release language (contributed by Pavel Borecki)
* HardenedBSD ASLR and PIE compilation for most binaries
* HardenedBSD SEGVGUARD to prevent ASLR brute force attacks
* PHP 7.0 compatibility and general GUI speed improvements
* improved password security (contributed by OSnet)
* FTP proxy plugin (contributed by Frank Brendel)
* PAM authentication module, e.g. 2FA on SSH
* IPsec tunnel isolation mode for interoperability
* Intel em(4) driver version 7.6.2 as a plugin
* micro versioning/migrations for config items
* constraint support for config items
* rewritten Nano images with growfs(8) support
* authentication methods are now fully pluggable
* firewall rules are now fully pluggable
* Tinc VPN Plugin
* FreeBSD 11.0

Known issues in this version:

* The inherited 6rd kernel patches are not included in standard
  FreeBSD 11.0.  The impact on 6rd setups is currently unknown.
* The installer character set is not entirely correct due to the
  default console switch to vt(4).
* Fundamental WiFi stack changes in FreeBDS 11.0 may still affect
  overall operability.
* Insight and Health statistics import from the early installer do not work.
* The LibreSSL version will not be available until the final release.

Any help in making 17.1 the best it could possibly be for its final
release at the end of January 2017 is highly appreciated.  Please do
