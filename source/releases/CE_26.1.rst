26.1  "Witty Woodpecker" Series
===========================================================================================



For over 11 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates, modern IPv6 support, as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

26.1, nicknamed "Witty Woodpecker", features almost a full firewall
MVC/API experience as automation rules have been promoted to the new
rules GUI, Suricata version 8 with inline inspection mode using "divert",
assorted IPv6 reliability and feature improvements, router advertisements
MVC/API, full code shell command escaping revamp, default IPv6
mode now using Dnsmsaq for client connectivity, Unbound blocklist source
selection, an automatic host discovery service, plus much more.

The upgrade path for 25.7 will likely be unlocked on January 29, which
is probably tomorrow if anyone is asking why it is not there yet.
We want to ensure the upgrade goes as smoothly as possible so please
be patient!  :)

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* ISC-DHCP moves to a plugin. It will be automatically installed during upgrades. It is not installed on new installations because it is not being used, but you can still install and keep using it.
* To accommodate the change away from ISC-DCHP defaults the "Track interface" IPv6 mode now has a sibling called "Identity Association" which does the same except it is not automatically starting ISC-DHCPv6 and Radvd router advertisements to allow better interoperability with Kea and Dnsmasq setups.
* Dnsmasq is now the default for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 as well as RA out of the box.  One thing that the upstream software cannot cover is prefix delegation so that is no longer offered by default.  Use another DHCPv6 server in this case.
* Due to command line execution safety concerns the historic functions mwexec_bg() and mwexec() will be removed in 26.1.x.  Make sure your custom code is not using them and use mwexecf(), mwexecfb() and mwexecfm() instead.
* The function sessionClose() has also been removed from the MVC code and is no longer needed.  Make sure to remove it from your custom code.
* The custom.yaml support has been removed from intrusion detection.  Please migrate to the newer /usr/local/etc/suricata/conf.d override directory.
* The new host discovery service "hostwatch" is enabled by default (since 25.7.11).  You can always turn it off under Interfaces: Neighbors: Automatic Discovery if you so choose.
* The firewall migration page is not something you need to jump into right away.  Please make yourself familiar with the new rules GUI first and check the documentation for incompatibilities.  Single interface from the floating interface will not be considered "floating" in priorities.
* Firewall: NAT: Port Forwarding is now called "Destination NAT".  Firewall rule associations are no longer supported, but the old associated firewall rules remain in place with their last known configuration and can now be edited to suit future needs.
* Firewall: NAT: Source NAT is from the set of pages formerly known as automation, but One to One NAT is still the main page for these types of rules.

26.1.r2 (January 26, 2026)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The second release candidate for 26.1 brings fixes for issues found by
our awesome community.  As an online-only update you need 26.1-RC1 to
install it.

The long-awaited dhcp6c refresh has been included as well as the latest
version for hostwatch addressing the community concerns collected from
25.7.11.

Here are the changes against version 26.1-RC1:

* system: add XMLRPC option for hostwatch
* interfaces: show ISC-DHCPv6 menu in "idassoc6" mode
* interfaces: fix validation issue in "idassoc6" mode
* interfaces: handle hostwatch user/group via package
* interfaces: avoid forced reloads when PDINFO is not set
* firewall: fix 3 issues and improve instructions in rule migration page
* firewall: improve GeoIP alias expiry condition
* firewall: escape selector in rule_protocol
* kea: add libdhcp_host_cmds.so to expose internal API commands for reservations
* kea: allow "hw-address" for reservations
* kea: add pool in subnet validation
* openvpn: account for CARP status in start and restart cases as well
* radvd: remove faulty empty address exception
* lang: various translation updates
* mvc: add ChangeCase support to ProtocolField for DNAT special case
* ports: dhcp6c v20260122
* ports: hostwatch 1.0.9

A hotfix release was issued as 26.1.r2_2:

* interfaces: if no idassoc6/track6 LAN is used also emit a PD request like before
* firewall: make previously associated DNAT rules editable

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

26.1.r1 (January 22, 2026)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here we are now with the first release candidate to kickstart the 26.1
series.  While this marks the end of an era as ISC-DHCP functionality
moves to a plugin it is only the beginning of structural improvements
and further innovation of topics that are important to our users: firewall
GUI and API, IPv6, intrusion detection using Suricata and overall security.

Keep in mind this is mostly an image-based pre-production test release.
Upgrades from the 25.7.11 development version will be available at some
point, but it is not clear when. An online-only RC2 will probably follow
as well.  The final release date for 26.1 is January 28.

https://pkg.opnsense.org/releases/26.1/

Here are the development highlights since version 25.7 came out:

* Introduce a new consistent rules GUI using MVC/API (formerly known as "Automation")
* Suricata version 8 and new inline inspection mode using "divert"
* NAT port forwarding migrated to "Destination NAT" as MVC/API
* Various IPv6 stability improvements and additional features
* Setup wizard improvements including use case selection
* Services: Router Advertisements migrated to MVC/API
* Shell command escaping improvements and audit
* Interfaces: Settings migrated to MVC/API
* Default IPv6 setup now relies on Dnsmasq
* Factory reset for individual components
* The firewall live log was rewritten
* Unbound blocklist source selection
* Automatic host discovery service

A more detailed change log will follow!

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* ISC-DHCP moves to a plugin. It will be automatically installed during upgrades. It is not installed on new installations because it is not being used, but you can still install and keep using it.
* To accommodate the change away from ISC-DCHP defaults the "Track interface" IPv6 mode now has a sibling called "Identity Association" which does the same except it is not automatically starting ISC-DHCPv6 and Radvd router advertisements to allow better interoperability with Kea and Dnsmasq setups.
* Due to command line execution safety concerns the historic functions mwexec_bg() and mwexec() will be removed in 26.1.x.  Make sure your custom code is not using them and use mwexecf(), mwexecfb() and mwexecfm() instead.
* The function sessionClose() has also been removed from the MVC code and is no longer needed.  Make sure to remove it from your custom code.
