===========================================================================================
21.1  "Marvelous Meerkat" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 6 years, OPNsense is driving innovation through modularising
and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable firmware
upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD security, fast adoption of
upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

21.1, nicknamed "Marvelous Meerkat", is the relentless continuation of
open source dedication.  The last 6 years were not always easy, but we
are happy to be where we are now and have the community to thank for it.

New and improved are the firewall rules and NAT categories, the traffic
graphs supporting IPv6 along with a visual refresh, intrusion detection
rule management by policies, an alias for MAC addresses and NAT over IPsec
with all phase 2 you could ever want.  Last but not least, the serial image
now supports UEFI as well.

For those wondering, the WireGuard plugin has been available since 2019 and
receives continuous improvements by its maintainer and various users alike.
And that is unlikey to change in the future.  ;)

As we continue to deprecate custom configuration inputs for a number of
reasons, Dnsmasq has been switched to a pluggable file-based approach `[1] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/dnsmasq.html>`__ 
with Unbound to follow in the upcoming 21.7 series.

Download links, an installation guide `[2] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html>`__  and the checksums for the images

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.1.6 (May 27, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


With a bit of delay we bring to you the usual mix of security and
reliability updates.  It is of note that the OpenVPN advisory tracked
as CVE-2020-15078 does not affect the provided version 2.4.11, but the
security audit will falsely flag it as vulnerable because the source
of the audit is FreeBSD where OpenVPN was migrated to 2.5 series already.

Plans for upcoming 21.1.x versions include a swift Phalcon 4 migration as
well as Python 3.8 and PHP 7.4 updates.

Here are the full patch notes:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.1.5 (April 21, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is mainly a security and reliablility update.  There are several FreeBSD
security advisories and updates for third party tools such as curl.

The historic bsdinstaller has been replaced by a scriptable alternative
based on the readily available bsdinstall bundled with the base system.
And, yes, this brings ZFS installer support into the upcoming 21.7 release.

On the development side the migration to Phalcon 4 framework is now underway
and brings improved UI/API responsiveness.  One of the remaining road map
goals is the migration to PHP 7.4 which can be carried out after said
framework update is complete and released.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.1.4 (March 30, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The third party crypto libraries need patching so here we go!  The number of
user contributions and interaction regarding stability fixes and improvements
from the OPNsense side seems to be picking up as well and that is great to see.

The development version includes an update of Suricata to version 6.0.2
in case any of you want to try it out.  Also, improvements in the DHCP
static mapping can now deal with IPv6 prefix merge for such deployments
using Unbound and Dnsmasq host registration.

In the past 3 months we have also been working on a business edition relaunch
and now feel obligated to quickly present the results of these efforts:

The upcoming release of the business edition will be versioned as 21.4 in
order to decouple it from the community release cycle.  To that end--and
to stay true to open source--we have published the release engineering core
branch for said business release `[1] <https://github.com/opnsense/core/commits/stable/21.4>`__ .

You will see more distinction between "community" and "business" in
communication, but the basic approach of a more conservative release
cycle in volume and timing for the business edition remains the same.
On top of this, the business edition also offers additional plugins,
e.g. for central management tasks.

* system: add assorted missing configuration sections for high availability sync

21.1.3 (March 10, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today we move ahead with the firmware UI and API rework as we are happy
with the new user experience.  You will also notice the new plugin conflict
dialog which will report that plugins have been installed previously but
not registered in the configuration.  This can be easily amended by reseting
the local conflicts, which essentially accepts the current plugin
configuration as the new default.  This necessary change introduces API
incompatibilities with existing external tools.

The HAProxy plugin was updated to version 3.0.  This release marks the
switch to the HAProxy 2.2 release series, which may result in incompatible
changes for some users.  Many new features were also added, including the
possibility to update SSL certificates in runtime.  These features should
be considered experimental.  We encourage everyone to install this version
in a test environment before using it in production.  As usual, please have
a look at the plugin changes `[1] <https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/21.1/net/haproxy/pkg-descr>`__  and report bugs on GitHub.

Work has so far been focused on the firmware update process to ensure

21.1 (January 28, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 6 years, OPNsense is driving innovation through modularising
and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable firmware
upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD security, fast adoption of
upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

21.1, nicknamed "Marvelous Meerkat", is the relentless continuation of
open source dedication.  The last 6 years were not always easy, but we
are happy to be where we are now and have the community to thank for it.

New and improved are the firewall rules and NAT categories, the traffic
graphs supporting IPv6 along with a visual refresh, intrusion detection
rule management by policies, an alias for MAC addresses and NAT over IPsec
with all phase 2 you could ever want.  Last but not least, the serial image
now supports UEFI as well.

For those wondering, the WireGuard plugin has been available since 2019 and
receives continuous improvements by its maintainer and various users alike.
And that is unlikey to change in the future.  ;)

As we continue to deprecate custom configuration inputs for a number of
reasons, Dnsmasq has been switched to a pluggable file-based approach `[1] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/dnsmasq.html>`__ 
with Unbound to follow in the upcoming 21.7 series.

can be found below as well.
