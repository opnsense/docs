25.7  "Visionary Viper" Series
===========================================================================================



For over a decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.7, nicknamed "Visionary Viper", features reusable and thoroughly
revamped frontend code, an SFTP backup plugin, experimental privilege
separation for the GUI, JSON container support for aliases, a new and
improved firewall automation GUI, performance enhancements especially
for numerous aliases being used at once, Dnsmasq DHCP support, Kea DHCPv6
support, Greek as a new language, FreeBSD 14.3 plus much more.

25.7.6 (October 22, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The usual lot of additions and reliability fixes is being rounded off with
Suricata version 8 and a new package manager version 2 almost two years in the
making -- at least for our project.

Please be aware that during the update check the new package manager will be
installed, but will fail to report the update status like it always had before
and so you will end up with an error that will require checking for updates
again.  The fix is in this update, but impossible to install without upgrading
the package manager first.  We hope this will only be a minor inconvenience
during the process.

Syslog-ng is also being updated and includes a fix that previously prevented
2.9.x from shipping since it would hang the boot during daemonize.  Many
thanks to the authors for quickly picking this up and providing a fixed version!

25.7.3 (September 09, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Tabulator introduction into MVC grid views was a major success with
virtually no complaints.  Did you notice?  Maybe you will now that more
features have been unlocked: Dnsmasq grids group by interfaces, firewall
automation rules now can show folders using categories and row count default
and selections have been increased.  A few performance and UX tweaks were
carried out as well while at it.

StrongSwan moves to version 6.0.1 now after elaborate testing.  The
"make_before_break" value was flipped from off to on in their version
jump, but the settings will still default to off for everyone unless
already otherwise configured.

25.7 (July 23, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For over a decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.7, nicknamed "Visionary Viper", features reusable and thoroughly
revamped frontend code, an SFTP backup plugin, experimental privilege
separation for the GUI, JSON container support for aliases, a new and
improved firewall automation GUI, performance enhancements especially
for numerous aliases being used at once, Dnsmasq DHCP support, Kea DHCPv6
support, Greek as a new language, FreeBSD 14.3 plus much more.

Download links, an installation guide `[1] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html>`__  and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.

* Reverted tunables "hw.ibrs_disable" and "vm.pmap.pti" to FreeBSD defaults.  If you want these set differently, then add them with an explicit value.
* While the mirror dns-root.de has been removed it will not be stripped from a running configuration and may keep working for a while longer.  To ensure updates, however, please choose a different mirror at your own convenience.
* Moved OpenVPN legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.
* Moved IPsec legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.

* Replace the setup wizard with a modern MVC/API variant
* Switch to reusable frontend code
* ChartJS 4 update and related functionality migrations
* User manager CSV export and import option
* New plugin for SFTP configuration backups
* Move frontend grid from Bootgrid to Tabulator
* Optional privilege separation for the web GUI (running as non-root)
* User/group manager adds optional source network constraint
* JSON container support for aliases
* Firewall automation GUI revamp
* Performance improvements when using large amounts of aliases
* Dnsmasq DHCP support for small and medium sized setups
* Support advanced (manual) configurations in Kea
* Add IPv6 support (including prefix delegation) to Kea
* Bridges MVC migration
* Migrate IPsec mobile page to MVC
* Greek as a new language
* FreeBSD 14.3

25.7.r1 (July 14, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


After a small struggle to finish the release candidate last week, it is
here now with FreeBSD 14.3 and lots of other highlights.  We will promise
to deliver full release notes once 25.7 is released, but for now we need
to get this going.

Keep in mind this is mostly an image-based pre-production test release.
Upgrades from the 25.1.11 development version will be available as soon as
that is out later this week.  An online-only RC2 will probably follow as
well.  The final release date for 25.7 is July 23.

https://pkg.opnsense.org/releases/25.7/

Here are the development highlights since version 25.1 came out:

* Replace the setup wizard with a modern MVC/API variant
* Switch to reusable frontend code
