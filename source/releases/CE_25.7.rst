25.7  "Visionary Viper" Series
===========================================================================================



For over a decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.7, nicknamed "Visionary Viper", features reusable and thoroughly
revamped frontend code, an SFTP backup plugin, experimental privilege
separation for the GUI, JSON container support for aliases, a new and
improved firewall automation GUI, performance enhancements especially
for numerous aliases being used at once, Dnsmasq DHCP support, Kea DHCPv6
support, Greek as a new language, FreeBSD 14.3 plus much more.

* While the mirror dns-root.de has been removed it will not be stripped from a running configuration and may keep working for a while longer.  To ensure updates, however, please choose a different mirror at your own convenience.
* Moved OpenVPN legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.

25.7.r1 (July 14, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


After a small struggle to finish the release candidate last week, it is
here now with FreeBSD 14.3 and lots of other highlights.  We will promise
to deliver full release notes once 25.7 is released, but for now we need
to get this going.

Keep in mind this is mostly an image-based pre-production test release.
Upgrades from the 25.1.11 development version will be available as soon as
that is out later this week.  An online-only RC2 will probably follow as
well.  The final release date for 25.7 is July 23.

https://pkg.opnsense.org/releases/25.7/

* Replace the setup wizard with a modern MVC/API variant
