25.7  "Visionary Viper" Series
===========================================================================================



For over a decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.7, nicknamed "Visionary Viper", features reusable and thoroughly
revamped frontend code, an SFTP backup plugin, experimental privilege
separation for the GUI, JSON container support for aliases, a new and
improved firewall automation GUI, performance enhancements especially
for numerous aliases being used at once, Dnsmasq DHCP support, Kea DHCPv6
support, Greek as a new language, FreeBSD 14.3 plus much more.

25.7.11 (January 15, 2026)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


25.7.11 comes at a strange point in time but we will try to offer a bit of
familiarity and common sense as we probably all need more of this.  <3

This release brings the new host discovery service which resolves and remembers
MAC addresses for IPv4 and IPv6 hosts in your connected networks and provides
this data for the firewall MAC aliases and captive portal clients.  It is now
enabled by default, but you can choose to opt out by disabling the automatic
discovery option.

Note to people who were already on 25.7.11 and 27.7.11_1: a modified hostwatch
version was published disabling two excessive log messages.  Applying the
hotfix 25.7.11_2 will not restart hostwatch.  Please do so under Interfaces:
Neighbors: Automatic Discovery by either using "apply" or the restart button
in the service widget.  Other reported issues will be addressed shortly.

A lot of work went into IPv6 improvements over the holidays as is tradition
with the help of users debugging their networks during that time.  A number
of kernel fixes have been supplied and dhcp6c will also receive a larger update
in 26.1 soon.

The changes are otherwise clustered around preparation for the major upgrade
which brings an number of fundamental changes with the ongoing removal of
ISC-DHCP from core.  A plugin is already available through the development
version and should auto-install.  If not make sure you install it before
attempting a reboot there.  For the stable version everything is as it was.

That being said, 26.1-RC1 will be out early next week and RC2 likely follows
quickly.  We are still set for a final release date of January 28.  See you on
the other side!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.7.10 (December 18, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update is released mainly due to the fact that FreeBSD-SA-25:12.rtsold `[2] <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-25:12.rtsold.asc>`__ 
has impact on WAN-facing DHCPv6 connectivity being used, but also offers a
mid-size batch of improvements like CARP VHID awareness for DHCRelay and
a thorough cleanup and improvement pass over the Suricata integration we
have been discussing during Suricon in November.

Of special note is that the captive portal accounting moves back to ipfw(4)
from pf(4) because in larger deployments accounting rules are much faster
this way and the use case of Ethernet-less captive portals such as on top
of WireGuard now work properly again.  The hook for pluggable pf(4) "ether"
rules remains for now but will be removed in 26.1 as we do not intend to
advocate its use.

Also, Python has reported security issues of which a DoS in http.client could
potentially affect existing installations given that an HTTP server sends
a malicious response which "can consume a large amount of memory and CPU time
and cause swapping".  Python has not released an update for version 3.11 at
this point in time.

* system: clean up and normalise the sample config.xml

25.7.9 (December 04, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


A bug snuck into the last release that did not properly disable the
caching of DNS entries when using multiple blocklists with different
network restrictions.  We have used the opportunity to polish the
notification code and apply behaviour during the migration of the
old blocklist to the new format.

as well.  Otherwise it is a rather quiet release and 2025 is almost

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.7.8 (November 26, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


So we are making way for safer command execution since a comment was
added to the certification of the business version about a possible
injection into interfaces_pfsync_configure() -- note that it was a comment
and not a security issue since the exploit requires to edit the config.xml
and/or do a configuration import.

The issue in interfaces_pfsync_configure() has now been fixed, but as
mentioned the idea was to get rid of these problems once and for all so
the Shell class was rewritten and every call was audited.  You will see
more movement on our way to 26.1 in this area as we do not want to push
all changes into the 25.7 series immediately so that they can be properly
verified first.  Suffice to say most of the code we worked on over the
years was already much safer due to the introduction of exec_safe() very
early in the project history.

The Unbound blocklists feature formerly known as a business feature is
now a community feature!  Since this required merging both the existing
community one with the business one you need to make sure to reapply the
blocklist settings after the reboot since it will not generate a new and
actually incompatible format.  Make sure to check your automatically
migrated settings while at it.

What does all of this mean?  It means security matters.  It also means
that community matters.  We will continue to improve the community version
because it is the base for the business version and that is exactly how
it should be so that everybody can benefit from these changes!

Note this release includes a new kernel with a lot of improvements in the
vtnet(4) driver department.  It is stable code according to release
engineering procedures of FreeBSD but if you are seeing specific issues let
us know.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: defaults: properly delete empty model containers in the configuration

25.7.7 (November 06, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update ships a number of third party security updates, firewall live
log improvements based on user feedback from 25.7.6, plus minor fixes and
improvements like usual.

One focus at the moment is to get rid of the unsafe shell use in the backend
which has been the source of multiple security issues in the project history.
A few other things are coming to 25.7.x soon: a neighbor watch daemon, a new
NDP proxy plugin and a community theme.  Stay tuned.  :)

Here are the full patch notes:

25.7.6 (October 22, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The usual lot of additions and reliability fixes is being rounded off with
Suricata version 8 and a new package manager version 2 almost two years in the
making -- at least for our project.

Please be aware that during the update check the new package manager will be
installed, but will fail to report the update status like it always had before
and so you will end up with an error that will require checking for updates
again.  The fix is in this update, but impossible to install without upgrading
the package manager first.  We hope this will only be a minor inconvenience
during the process.

Syslog-ng is also being updated and includes a fix that previously prevented
2.9.x from shipping since it would hang the boot during daemonize.  Many
thanks to the authors for quickly picking this up and providing a fixed version!

* system: safeguard config history delete and revert by requiring HTTP POST method

25.7.3 (September 09, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Tabulator introduction into MVC grid views was a major success with
virtually no complaints.  Did you notice?  Maybe you will now that more
features have been unlocked: Dnsmasq grids group by interfaces, firewall
automation rules now can show folders using categories and row count default
and selections have been increased.  A few performance and UX tweaks were
carried out as well while at it.

StrongSwan moves to version 6.0.1 now after elaborate testing.  The
"make_before_break" value was flipped from off to on in their version
jump, but the settings will still default to off for everyone unless
already otherwise configured.

25.7 (July 23, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For over a decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.7, nicknamed "Visionary Viper", features reusable and thoroughly
revamped frontend code, an SFTP backup plugin, experimental privilege
separation for the GUI, JSON container support for aliases, a new and
improved firewall automation GUI, performance enhancements especially
for numerous aliases being used at once, Dnsmasq DHCP support, Kea DHCPv6
support, Greek as a new language, FreeBSD 14.3 plus much more.

* Reverted tunables "hw.ibrs_disable" and "vm.pmap.pti" to FreeBSD defaults.  If you want these set differently, then add them with an explicit value.
* While the mirror dns-root.de has been removed it will not be stripped from a running configuration and may keep working for a while longer.  To ensure updates, however, please choose a different mirror at your own convenience.
* Moved OpenVPN legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.
* Moved IPsec legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.

* Firewall automation GUI revamp
* Performance improvements when using large amounts of aliases
* Dnsmasq DHCP support for small and medium sized setups
* Support advanced (manual) configurations in Kea
* Add IPv6 support (including prefix delegation) to Kea
* Bridges MVC migration
* Migrate IPsec mobile page to MVC
* Greek as a new language
* FreeBSD 14.3

25.7.r1 (July 14, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


After a small struggle to finish the release candidate last week, it is
here now with FreeBSD 14.3 and lots of other highlights.  We will promise
to deliver full release notes once 25.7 is released, but for now we need
to get this going.

Keep in mind this is mostly an image-based pre-production test release.
Upgrades from the 25.1.11 development version will be available as soon as
that is out later this week.  An online-only RC2 will probably follow as
well.  The final release date for 25.7 is July 23.

https://pkg.opnsense.org/releases/25.7/

Here are the development highlights since version 25.1 came out:

* Replace the setup wizard with a modern MVC/API variant
* Switch to reusable frontend code
