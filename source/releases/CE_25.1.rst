25.1  "Ultimate Unicorn" Series
===========================================================================================



For an entire decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.1, nicknamed "Ultimate Unicorn", features numerous MVC/API conversions,
improved security zones support and documentation, ZFS snapshot support,
a new UI look with a light and dark theme, PHP 8.3, FreeBSD 14.2 plus much
more.

25.1.4 (March 26, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update offers support for "jq" syntax in JSON-based URL table
aliases, new OpenVPN instance features and the mandatory batch of
stability improvements in numerous parts of the GUI and backend.

Upcoming in 25.1.5 are better RADIUS integration and enabling message
authentication.  We are also replacing the captive portal implementation
by moving from ipfw(4) to pf(4).  Last but not least the firewall automation
filter rules GUI received a generous revamp for a far better UX than before.
You can preview these changes by switching to the development release type

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.1.3 (March 11, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This time around a patch from OpenBSD has been added that fixes the
state tracking for ICMPv6 neighbour discovery packets through pf.  The
user management gained a CSV import/export.  Also, the bug of the missing
PPP logs has been fixed in the upstream MPD package.

Please note that the FRR plugin now uses the new configuration file
layout mandated by upstream and also gained reload support.

Since Google Drive is being phased out by Google, a new plugin now
covers backups via SFTP.  The old Google Drive backup functionality
will move to plugins in 25.7 since it will only be useful for existing
installs.

* system: implement user CSV import/export functionality (sponsored by: m.a.x. it)

25.1.2 (February 28, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This was supposed to hit earlier this week, but some weeks are like this
one now where QA takes more time than usual.  Of note is the move of Dnsmasq
to MVC and the ChartJS update to version 4 which is bundled with nice updates
for widgets and the system health graphs.

The roadmap for 25.7 was also published `[1] <https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/>`__ .  The IPsec and OpenVPN legacy
parts will move to the plugins so that the functionality can live there
in community support tier.  Since Kea remains a bit of an odd choice we will
be offering DHCP support via Dnsmasq as a new standard feature which also
offers seamless DHCP lease registration some people keep looking for.

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The access management was rewritten in MVC and contains behavioural changes including not rendering UNIX accounts for non-shell users. The integrated authentication via PAM has been the default for a long time so the option to disable it has been removed. The manual LDAP importer is no longer available since LDAP/RADIUS authenticators support on-demand creation and default group setup option. The "page-system-groupmanager-addprivs" privilege was removed since the page does not exist anymore. A multi-purpose privilege editor has been added under the existing "page-system-usermanager-addprivs" instead.
* PPP devices can no longer be configured on the interface settings page. To edit the device settings use the native PPP device edit page instead.
* FreeBSD 14.2 comes with the stock pf(4) behaviour regarding ICMPv6 neighbour discovery state tracking which was avoided so far in 24.7.x.
* Let's Encrypt ends support for the OCSP Must Staple extension on 30.01.2025. Issuance requests will fail if this option is still enabled past this date.

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The access management was rewritten in MVC and contains behavioural changes including not rendering UNIX accounts for non-shell users. The integrated authentication via PAM has been the default for a long time so the option to disable it has been removed. The manual LDAP importer is no longer available since LDAP/RADIUS authenticators support on-demand creation and default group setup option. The "page-system-groupmanager-addprivs" privilege was removed since the page does not exist anymore. A multi-purpose privilege editor has been added under the existing "page-system-usermanager-addprivs" instead.
* PPP devices can no longer be configured on the interface settings page. To edit the device settings use the native PPP device edit page instead.
* FreeBSD 14.2 comes with the stock pf(4) behaviour regarding ICMPv6 neighbour discovery state tracking which was avoided so far in 24.7.x.
* Let's Encrypt ends support for the OCSP Must Staple extension on 30.01.2025. Issuance requests will fail if this option is still enabled past this date.

will follow in early January.
