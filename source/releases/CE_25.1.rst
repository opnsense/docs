25.1.7 (May 19, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Dnsmasq DHCP is here and now it is going to be even better with multiple
fixes thanks to the swift feedback we received.  We are aware of the
complex topic of DHCP in the recent years so keep in mind we added Dnsmasq
to fill a specific need for smaller installations that other services cannot
offer.  There are still areas where Kea shines so having both options is
the best way forward.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: safeguard local_group_set() since users may not exist for valid reasons
* interfaces: emulate device name return in ifconfig edge case for legacy_interface_create()

25.1.6 (May 08, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


After some back and forth today we are rolling back a console default
change done in FreeBSD 14.2 that we do not think is necessary at this
particular point in time.  The bridge configuration code was also
refactored to introduce it to MVC/API in an upcoming stable release.

A few more problems with the new captive portal backend have also been
addressed in order to make it match the behaviour of the previous one.
It is now possible to disable the automatic rules to further refine
the desired captive portal behaviour.

Last but not least: Kea DHCPv6 is here.  And with it full DHCP and router
advertisement support in Dnsmasq to bridge the gap for ISC users who do not
need or want Kea.  We are going to make Dnsmasq DHCP the default in new
installations starting with 25.7, too.  ISC DHCP will still be around as
a core component in 25.7 but likely moves to plugins for 26.1 next year.

25.1.5 (April 10, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This release improves overall RADIUS support, moves the captive portal
from IPFW to PF, creates visibility of external certificate sources in
the system and offers a glimpse into the filter automation GUI revamp
which could one day replace the remaining static firewall rules edit pages.

and we would really like to continue that trend.  Also brace for impact

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.1.4 (March 26, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update offers support for "jq" syntax in JSON-based URL table
aliases, new OpenVPN instance features and the mandatory batch of
stability improvements in numerous parts of the GUI and backend.

Upcoming in 25.1.5 are better RADIUS integration and enabling message
authentication.  We are also replacing the captive portal implementation
by moving from ipfw(4) to pf(4).  Last but not least the firewall automation
filter rules GUI received a generous revamp for a far better UX than before.
You can preview these changes by switching to the development release type

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.1.3 (March 11, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This time around a patch from OpenBSD has been added that fixes the
state tracking for ICMPv6 neighbour discovery packets through pf.  The
user management gained a CSV import/export.  Also, the bug of the missing
PPP logs has been fixed in the upstream MPD package.

Please note that the FRR plugin now uses the new configuration file
layout mandated by upstream and also gained reload support.

Since Google Drive is being phased out by Google, a new plugin now
covers backups via SFTP.  The old Google Drive backup functionality
will move to plugins in 25.7 since it will only be useful for existing
installs.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: implement user CSV import/export functionality (sponsored by: m.a.x. it)

25.1.2 (February 28, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This was supposed to hit earlier this week, but some weeks are like this
one now where QA takes more time than usual.  Of note is the move of Dnsmasq
to MVC and the ChartJS update to version 4 which is bundled with nice updates
for widgets and the system health graphs.

The roadmap for 25.7 was also published `[1] <https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/>`__ .  The IPsec and OpenVPN legacy
parts will move to the plugins so that the functionality can live there
in community support tier.  Since Kea remains a bit of an odd choice we will
be offering DHCP support via Dnsmasq as a new standard feature which also
offers seamless DHCP lease registration some people keep looking for.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: adjust gateway widget to use the intended caching mechanism

* firewall: add missing "persist" on bogonsv6
* captive portal: urlencode() selector items in voucher group list
* dhcrelay: integrate layout_partials bootgrid/apply
* dnsmasq: migrate existing frontend to MVC/API
* ipsec: add deprecation notices for legacy components (will move to plugins)
* kea-dhcp: add "v6-only-preferred" option (contributed by darses)

25.1 (January 29, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For an entire decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.1, nicknamed "Ultimate Unicorn", features numerous MVC/API conversions,
improved security zones support and documentation, ZFS snapshot support,
a new UI look with a light and dark theme, PHP 8.3, FreeBSD 14.2 plus much
more.

Download links, an installation guide `[1] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html>`__  and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The access management was rewritten in MVC and contains behavioural changes including not rendering UNIX accounts for non-shell users. The integrated authentication via PAM has been the default for a long time so the option to disable it has been removed. The manual LDAP importer is no longer available since LDAP/RADIUS authenticators support on-demand creation and default group setup option. The "page-system-groupmanager-addprivs" privilege was removed since the page does not exist anymore. A multi-purpose privilege editor has been added under the existing "page-system-usermanager-addprivs" instead.
* PPP devices can no longer be configured on the interface settings page. To edit the device settings use the native PPP device edit page instead.
* FreeBSD 14.2 comes with the stock pf(4) behaviour regarding ICMPv6 neighbour discovery state tracking which was avoided so far in 24.7.x.
* Let's Encrypt ends support for the OCSP Must Staple extension on 30.01.2025. Issuance requests will fail if this option is still enabled past this date.

25.1.b (December 19, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The 25.1 series will include FreeBSD 14.2 so we are putting this BETA
version out based on the latest development state.  This is not meant
for production use but all plugins are provided and future updates of
installations based on these images will be possible.

https://pkg.opnsense.org/releases/25.1/

There is a bit more work to be done yet most of the milestones have
already been reached.  If you have a test deployment or would like to
check out some of the new features these images are for you.  Together
we can make OPNsense better than it ever was.

The final release date for 25.1 is January 29.  A release candidate
will follow in early January.

Highlights over version 24.7 include:

* system: restructure PPP to accomodate IPv6-only deployments
* system: implement persistent notifications banner
* system: dashboard widget for certificate expiry and renew
* system: high availablilty status MVC/API conversion
* system: users and groups MVC/API conversion
* system: advanced trust settings page
* system: ZFS snapshot GUI
* reporting: RRD health graph refactoring
* firewall: improved security zones support and documentation
* ipsec: advanced settings MVC/API conversion
* unbound: merge domain overrides into query forwarding
* ui: theme update with new styling and add official dark theme
* src: FreeBSD 14.2
