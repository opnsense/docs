===========================================================================================
22.7  "Powerful Panther" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 7 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

22.7, nicknamed "Powerful Panther", features the upgrade to FreeBSD 13.1,
PHP 8.0, Phalcon 5, stacked VLAN and Intel QuickAssist (QAT) support,
DDoS protection using SYN cookies, MVC/API pages for IPsec status and
Unbound overrides, new APCUPSD and CrowdSec plugins plus much more.

LibreSSL flavour is scheduled for removal at the end of this series
and will likely receive no further maintenance.  Software failing to
work properly starting with Tor will have its plugin removed from the
flavour from now on to be able to keep updating the software to their
latest versions in the OpenSSL flavour.  The next major upgrade will
automatically transition to the OpenSSL flavour, but we would encourage
everyone to switch between 22.7.x for the least amount of possible impact.

22.7.1 (August 09, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update first and foremost addresses reported regressions with the
initial version and the required security update for Unbound.  Expect
follow-up releases to be a bit more noisy as we are going to introduce
the new notification system and further IPv6 improvements plus new roadmap
items to be announced in the upcoming weeks.

A hotfix release was issued as 22.7_4:

* system: IXR_Library using incorrect constructor format for PHP 8
* interfaces: fix issues with PPP uptime display in PHP 8
* firewall: do not emit link-local address on IPv6 network outbound NAT
* mvc: remove stray error_reporting(E_ALL) calls

Known issues and limitations:

* The DH parameter is no longer available in OpenVPN server configuration and now fixed to the RFC 7919 4096 bit key.  The only downside may be lower performance on older machines.
* The infamous /var MFS feature was reduced to the /var/log scope in order to avoid future issues with plugins requiring persistent storage under /var.  In practice people who used /var MFS had no benefit over it with software that required persistent storage under /var to operate in the first place.  Periodic configuration file writes to /var are negligible on SSD-based systems.
* The os-dyndns plugin is still available due to the fact that ddclient did not release a non-development release so far since we started os-ddclient.  Availability thereof might change later in 22.7.x.
* The console firmware update will now display text-based changelogs for the update to be installed if available.  Use the arrow keys to scroll the changelog and type "q" to resume the update process.
* The manual DHCPv6 tracking mode now requires a proper prefix range given like its counterpart with a static address.  If a previous prefix ID type input is detected only setting the lower 64 bits of an IPv6 address, a warning is emitted and the ID is treated as the upper 64 bits of an IPv6 address instead.  If your DHCPv6 server does not start please properly fix the given range.
