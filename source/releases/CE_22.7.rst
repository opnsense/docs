===========================================================================================
22.7  "Powerful Panther" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 7 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

22.7, nicknamed "Powerful Panther", features the upgrade to FreeBSD 13.1,
PHP 8.0, Phalcon 5, stacked VLAN and Intel QuickAssist (QAT) support,
DDoS protection using SYN cookies, MVC/API pages for IPsec status and
Unbound overrides, new APCUPSD and CrowdSec plugins plus much more.

LibreSSL flavour is scheduled for removal at the end of this series
and will likely receive no further maintenance.  Software failing to
work properly starting with Tor will have its plugin removed from the
flavour from now on to be able to keep updating the software to their
latest versions in the OpenSSL flavour.  The next major upgrade will
automatically transition to the OpenSSL flavour, but we would encourage
everyone to switch between 22.7.x for the least amount of possible impact.

22.7.11 (January 18, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This will be the end of life release for the 22.7 series with only a small
number of reliability updates.  Upgrades to 23.1-RC1 are possible from the
development version of this release.  We do expect an online update for RC2
next week.

The final 23.1 release will be on January 26.  As always the upgrade path
from the community version will be added as a hotfix shortly after the final
release announcement is published.  However, this time around LibreSSL will
no longer update and must be switched to the OpenSSL flavour prior to the
upgrade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.7.8 (November 17, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a small maintenance and security update.  You will notice that
LibreSSL no longer works with FreeRADIUS software due to hiding library
internals that are used by the software.  Your current install will
continue to work, but we would recommend switching to OpenSSL to receive
FreeRADIUS updates as they become available.

Also, the infamous log_error() message is being phased out in the development
version to end the questions of "Why is this log message an error?" and so
with log_msg() each log line receives a more appropriate log level between
error, warning and notice.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: add statistics tree view containing vmstat memory characteristics
* system: explicitly reopen main log file in case another log file was used and closed
* system: tweak log_msg() to prepare log level adjustments migration away from log_error()
* system: enforce config reload to fetch group membership in authentication tester
* system: separate interface type icon from name column in interface widget
* system: change system log default to "Notice"
* system: UX tweaks on activity page
* system: revised backend daemon startup delay
* system: drop empty plugins_run() result
* interfaces: migrate main clearing of interface data to ifctl
* interfaces: fix display of special HTML characters in packet capture
* interfaces: retain existing PPP settings on saving interface settings
* interfaces: delete the correct lock of PPP device
* interfaces: fix variable use in interface_proxyarp_configure()
* firewall: wrap user rule registration in new function filter_core_rules_user()
* firewall: simplify rule lookup by using filter_core_rules_user()
* firewall: allow external dynamic address in NPT
* firewall: remove extended VIP expansion from NAT rules
* firewall: fix live view hostname lookup may result in HTTP 431 error
* ipsec: remove side effect host route removal from Phase 1 page
* unbound: do not stop on potential errors in start script
* plugins: os-freeradius is no longer available for LibreSSL to allow updates of FreeRADIUS software
* plugins: os-nginx 1.31 `[1] <https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/22.7/www/nginx/pkg-descr>`__

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.7.7 (November 03, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


We replaced the packet capture tool with a MVC/API rewrite and
updated most plugins to use the new setup script facility when
doing a start/restart/reload through the RC system.

A number of FreeBSD kernel improvements have been included as well.

popular vulnerability only exists in version 3 and we still use
1.1.1.

A hotfix release was issued as 22.7.7_1:

* openvpn: ifctl requires interface to operate



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.7.6 (October 12, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update fixes CRL code handling with third party software and sandboxes
the code to avoid dealing with boot-time issues ever again.  However, due to
the nature of the sandboxing no automatic fix can be made for the following
case:

Creating and using an empty CRL in OpenVPN broke in 22.7.5 due to an ancient
bug not populating the empty CRL in binary format: the side effect "correcting"
this at runtime was removed.  22.7.6 will now correctly populate the binary
format of the empty CRL upon creation in the config.xml as originally intended.

The options to manually fix existing empty CRLs are as follows:

* Remove the CRL from OpenVPN as it is unused anyway, or
* Add a dummy certificate to it to populate the CRL properly, or
* Add and remove a random existing certificate to populate an empty CRL.

These fixes can be carried out on older installation without a problem as well
prior to upgrading to avoid OpenVPN from not working post-upgrade.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: fix inconsistent is_crl_internal() implementation
* system: make sure we always generate a CRL when saved
* system: sandbox code handling CRL manipulation in the CRL manager page
* system: wrap global product information handling into a singleton
* system: move get_nameservers() to ifctl use
* reporting: traffic graph polling interval selection and UX tweaks
* interfaces: port 6RD/6to4 to ifctl use
* interfaces: optionally use reverse DNS resolution for ARP table hostnames (contributed by soif)
* interfaces: allow user-configurable VLAN device names with certain restrictions `[1] <https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues/6038>`__ 
* interfaces: small cleanup on get_real_interface()
* firewall: simplify port forward rule logic for delete and toggle and make sure to toggle firewall rule as well
* firewall: various performance and usability improvements in live log
* firewall: extend all firewall rules with a UUID to align with MVC code upon edit
* firmware: display license validity when applicable in business edition
* ipsec: ACL fix for sessions users
* unbound: support setting type value for DNS over TLS/Query Forwarding API (contributed by kulikov-a)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.7.5 (October 05, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today we are fixing a security issue involving the "installer" user and
kernel-based TCP panics that some have been fighting with since FreeBSD 13.
Some ports and plugins have also been updated now that the holiday season
is coming to its inevitable end.

The security issue arises on fresh 22.7 installs only due to a boot-time
optimization of user account handling since 22.1.8.  Users are not reset
on each boot anymore which improved boot times with many users but also made
the "installer" user stick with the default password in this situation.
Physical access to the console with this user was possible under these
conditions even after installation and updates were completed.  SSH access
was also possible when both not restricting login to keys and allowing root
login manually.  The mandatory reboot after the update to 22.7.5 or higher
remedies this problem.

In a default install the issue could only be exploited by manual console
access.  In general we want to advise users not to yield shell/console
access to non-administrators, restrict physical access if applicable, and
not offer SSH access based on user accounts, especially when SSH is accessible
from the WAN side without a VPN.

In any case we recommend all users of 22.7.x to update immediately or
take the necessary precautions to avoid the "installer" user from being
accessed in an unauthorized fashion.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: remove stray installer account from fresh 22.7 installations
* system: only use withPadding() for RSA based public keys in CRL code
* system: remove unnecessary crl_update() calls in CRL code
* system: extend pool options support in gateway groups
* system: move get_searchdomains() to ifctl use and allow FQDN
* system: add replacement hook for rc.resolv_conf_generate script
* system: replace "dns reload" backend call with portable alternative

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.7.4 (September 07, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update addresses more issues with the somewhat unfortunate phpseclib 3
migration.  WAN IPv6 SLAAC mode now works more reliably and TLS 1.3 web GUI
configurations will enforce the expectations by software clients regarding
interoperability.

Last but not least the "assign VLAN parent and enable" migration note from
22.1 is no longer required as the boot will attempt to configure all existing
hardware devices once with the selected defaults.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: enforce RFC 8446 by requiring TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 for TLS 1.3

22.7.3 (September 01, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Pick up the new FreeBSD security advisories while also introducing assorted
reliability improvements.  CRL now works again for elliptic curve with the
adoption of version 3 of phpseclib.  Wireless handling was improved due to
PHP 8 errors and coding style issues.  It is also the subject of further work
for 23.1.

22.7 (July 28, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 7 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

22.7, nicknamed "Powerful Panther", features the upgrade to FreeBSD 13.1,
PHP 8.0, Phalcon 5, stacked VLAN and Intel QuickAssist (QAT) support,
DDoS protection using SYN cookies, MVC/API pages for IPsec status and
Unbound overrides, new APCUPSD and CrowdSec plugins plus much more.

LibreSSL flavour is scheduled for removal at the end of this series
and will likely receive no further maintenance.  Software failing to
work properly starting with Tor will have its plugin removed from the
flavour from now on to be able to keep updating the software to their
latest versions in the OpenSSL flavour.  The next major upgrade will
automatically transition to the OpenSSL flavour, but we would encourage
everyone to switch between 22.7.x for the least amount of possible impact.

A hotfix release was issued as 22.7_4:

* system: IXR_Library using incorrect constructor format for PHP 8
* interfaces: fix issues with PPP uptime display in PHP 8
* firewall: do not emit link-local address on IPv6 network outbound NAT
* mvc: remove stray error_reporting(E_ALL) calls

Known issues and limitations:

* The DH parameter is no longer available in OpenVPN server configuration and now fixed to the RFC 7919 4096 bit key.  The only downside may be lower performance on older machines.
* The infamous /var MFS feature was reduced to the /var/log scope in order to avoid future issues with plugins requiring persistent storage under /var.  In practice people who used /var MFS had no benefit over it with software that required persistent storage under /var to operate in the first place.  Periodic configuration file writes to /var are negligible on SSD-based systems.
* The os-dyndns plugin is still available due to the fact that ddclient did not release a non-development release so far since we started os-ddclient.  Availability thereof might change later in 22.7.x.
* The console firmware update will now display text-based changelogs for the update to be installed if available.  Use the arrow keys to scroll the changelog and type "q" to resume the update process.
* The manual DHCPv6 tracking mode now requires a proper prefix range given like its counterpart with a static address.  If a previous prefix ID type input is detected only setting the lower 64 bits of an IPv6 address, a warning is emitted and the ID is treated as the upper 64 bits of an IPv6 address instead.  If your DHCPv6 server does not start please properly fix the given range.

A hotfix release was issued as 22.7.r1_8:

* system: disable RRD and NetFlow shutdown backups by default
* system: render interfaces in convert_config()
* interfaces: fix unable to bring up multiple loopback (contributed Johnny S. Lee)
* interfaces: fix unable to bring up multiple VXLAN
* interfaces: check if int before passing to convert_seconds_to_hms()
* ipsec: small UX tweaks in status page
* mvc: fix rowCount when all is selected in searchRecordsetBase()
* plugins: os-nginx fix for missing DH parameter file
* plugins: os-postfix fix for missing DH parameter file

Known issues and limitations:

* The DH parameter is no longer available in OpenVPN server configuration and now fixed to the RFC 7919 4096 bit key.  The only downside may be lower performance on older machines.
* The infamous /var MFS feature was reduced to the /var/log scope in order to avoid future issues with plugins requiring persistent storage under /var.  In practice people who used /var MFS had no benefit over it with software that required persistent storage under /var to operate in the first place.  Periodic configuration file writes to /var are negligible on SSD-based systems.
