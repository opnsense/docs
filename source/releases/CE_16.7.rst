16.7.8 (November 16, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today we present to you the latest stable iteration of the 16.7
series focusing on improved reliability and security in all areas
and major feature upgrades.

Big news this week are the inclusion of two new fully-featured
plugins for Tinc VPN and FTP proxying, the latter being kindly
sponsored by EURO-LOG AG `[1] <http://www.eurolog.com/>`__ .  Together with the community we are
continuing the trend towards a comprehensive plugins environment
based on top of our distinctive MVC GUI framework, with more plugins
already in direct development.

Speaking of such, the MVC framework received fine-grained versioning
and constraint support as well as a completely revamped API error
handling and plugin-compatible authentication handling.

Last but not least, enclosed within are third-party software updates,
most importantly the latest versions of LibreSSL, Bind, Sudo, OpenVPN,
Suricata, PHP and Curl.

A reboot is not strictly necessary, but recommended.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: trigger xmlrpc sync before service action

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.7.7 (October 27, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update brings several reliability and security improvements
as usual.  Our LibreSSL fans will notice the version 2.3 has finally
been replaced with 2.4 and we switched to position independent
executables in our base system to make good use of HardenedBSD ASLR.

Another hot topic is the addition of a Czech translation into the
release.  Many thanks to pavelb for making that happen!

Overall progress towards OPNsense 17.1 is steady: native PAM support
is through the testing phase and major FreeBSD upgrade support is
already enclosed within this very update.  Our next step is the release
of beta images some time during November.

Here are the full patch notes:

* captive portal: add expire voucher option
* intrusion detection: added support for compressed rule files

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.7.6 (October 11, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update is preparation for the upcoming major release firmware
upgrades, because FreeBSD 11.0 just came out (yay!).  The intended
target for this version is OPNsense 17.1, so it feels only natural
to add the bits and bolts for it as early as possible.  Seamless
upgrades from any major release to the next is our mission.  :)

A few security-related ports got updated to their latest versions
and we have fixed the PSK-related IPsec regression that sneaked
into 16.7.5.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: add language selection to initial wizard
* system: allow disabling the root user
* firmware: new mirror in Serbia (contributed by FourDots `[1] <https://fourdots.com/>`__ )
* firmware: assorted changes for upcoming major upgrade

* ports: unbound 1.5.10 `[5] <https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/download/#unbound-1-5-10>`__ 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.7.5 (September 28, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now that we got the chance to ship not one, but two OpenSSL bumps at
the same time we barely missed the LibreSSL updates.  That is life.
But we still have a few great things to offer this week.

First and foremost, users noted that the captive portal did not work
with the transparent proxy.  This lead to internal investigation into
the operating system kernel itself, where a number of issues with using
several packet filters in a row can lead to shortcuts in packet paths
through the networking stack.

This circled back to a simple fix for the captive portal: you can now
edit each zone to enable the proxy for HTTP (port 3128) or HTTPS (port
3129) for captive portal use without requiring the firewall redirect.
You only have to make sure you actually have your captive portal
interface set up as an interface in the proxy.

We will continue to look into the remaining kernel issues and give
updates and calls for testing when we reach new milestones.

In other news, both OpenVPN and IPsec received several improvements
for interoperability and the occasional bug with the missing firewall
rules tab for their respective interfaces.

Here are the full patch notes:

* captive portal: handle transparent proxy from within the zone configuration
* openvpn: adapt to cipher output changes in OpenVPN 2.3.12
* openvpn: improve plugin probing for virtual interface
* openvpn: added missing IPv6 tunnel network to overrides
* ipsec: human-readable format of authentication method in overview
* ipsec: refine behaviour of enable/apply on main page
* ipsec: deduplicate leftsubnet/rightsubnet for meshed IKEv2
* ipsec: more elegant interface and service plugging
* ipsec: added unmeshed "tunnel isolation" mode for IKEv2
* ipsec: cleanup pass over backend code
* ipsec: allow Camellia for IKEv2
* ipsec: allow %any in phase 1
* ipsec: allow EAP-MSCHAPV2
* system: load if_bridge on boot to correctly set its sysctl values
* system: do not explicitly call plugins_interfaces() anymore
* services: DNS resolver translation fixes (contributed by Fabian Franz)
* services: fix a race in the DynDNS widget display
* ports: curl 7.50.3 `[1] <https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2016-09/0040.html>`__ , sudo 1.8.18 `[2] <https://www.sudo.ws/stable.html#1.8.18>`__ , php 5.6.26 `[3] <https://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.6.26>`__ , openssl 1.0.2j `[4] <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt>`__  `[5] <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160926.txt>`__ 
* src: Multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities `[5] <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160926.txt>`__ 
* src: updated tzdata to 2016f `[6] <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:26.openssl.asc>`__ 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.7.4 (September 22, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


We are deliberately skipping waiting for OpenSSL to announce their
new version today as the roundtrip time for incorporating patches
and updates into FreeBSD and maybe also LibreSSL will likely delay
an update to next week.  We will simply do a 16.7.5 next week as
well and let 16.7.4 stand on its own feet.

The prominent theme of this update is CARP.  We have identified
a number of issues with the way it was being set up and reverted
the process back to what BSD standards recommend.  We have a shiny
new test lab to preview and scrutinise these changes in a larger
environment.  The tests were promising.  Let us know what you think!

Another thing is the introduction of the Intel Gigabit driver plugin
based on the stock driver code version 7.6.2 as multiple reports
popped up regarding driver reliability.  If you are having trouble
with CARP or intrusion detection IPS mode with your em(4) driver,
try installing the new plugin and reboot to activate.

The full list of changes is a follows:

* system: SSH-enabled installer and associated changes
* system: deprecate DSA keys as per OpenSSH recommendation
* system: reworked config import / export for consistency
* system: reboot after config import is now selectable
* system: fix improper escape of HTML entities in log file filter
* system: handle legal boolean return result from searchUsers()
  (contributed by Evgeny Bevz)
* system: add dynamic DNS update to cron
* system: fix race in php.ini setup

16.7.2 (August 18, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The release schedule is being stretched bit by bit to see how long we
can go without an update.  Well, we did not want wait any longer to
share with you the following bits... so here they are.  ;)

FreeBSD incorporated several reliability fixes for Hyper-V and we had
to back out an ICMP stable commit that was not fully working for trace
route output over the network.  There are several important ports
updates, namely Lighttpd, Strongswan and OpenSSH all brought to their
latest versions.

On our side, multi-point VPN plugins have been corrected to properly
group to their respective firewall rule interface.  For anyone waiting
to migrate their VPNs from 16.1.20 to 16.7, now is the time to do so!
Also, the stale OpenVPN windows binaries have been removed.  Note that
we gracefully support configuration file export in several formats.

16.7.r2 (July 14, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


16.7-RC2 is here and brings major additions to amd64 architectures: Intel
Hyperscan library to speed up Suricata rule matching and UEFI boot support!
It also brings language packs to their correct 16.7 state, with Japanese
already having been completed by the amazing Chie Taguchi.

The mirrors have been expanded to allow trackers of -stable or -devel
packages to upgrade to the release candidate.  Users of LibreSSL wanting
to upgrade can now switch to OpenSSL instead of seeing upgrade errors
until LibreSSL becomes available again and their systems move back to
LibreSSL automatically.

Otherwise, only minor issues have been reported and fixed.  This likely
means there will not be another release candidate.

New images are available from all known mirrors, checksums are found below:

https://opnsense.org/download/

16.7.r1 (July 04, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It has been 5 months since 16.1 came out.  Since then, over 1500 commits
and 18 stable releases have continuously improved and enhanced the
project.  Since then, thousands of new users have joined.  And, since
then, our new documentation has been extended and tweaked with numerous
guides, explanations and answers to your questions.

The cumulation of these efforts is this announcement of the first release
candidate for 16.7.  Images are being provided to encourage to try these
in a fresh setting, but the config import in the installer and the GUI
work as usual so that migration is simple.  Checksums for the images can
be found below.  VGA images have been omitted to permit work on the UEFI
variant in the meantime.

https://opnsense.org/download/

The RC cycle will end in a month with the actual 16.7 release so that
early birds will not have to reinstall afterwards.  Remember: feedback
is key in this phase, feel free to contact us in any way you like and
let us make 16.7 grand together.

Here is our list of major features that were worked on since 16.1:

* SSL fingerprinting / blacklisting in the IDS/IPS
