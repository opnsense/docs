16.1  "Crafty Coyote" Series
===========================================================================================



No, we would not say it was easy getting here, but booting into 16.1
for the first time sure is as relieving (and exciting) as it could get
for our project growing beyond what we had ever imagined.  It has been
more than a year since OPNsense first came out.  Back then it was
FreeBSD 10.0.  Not even two months after, 10.1 was introduced along
with the opnsense-update utility.  Today is the day for FreeBSD 10.2,
the latest and greatest release currently available for broader driver
support and stability improvements.

16.1 is nicknamed "Crafty Coyote" in honour of our beloved childhood
TV sessions.  It is the accumulation of 6 months of work, having had
our focus on reengineering the captive portal, native intrusion
prevention, plugin support, and transforming the reporting frontend
into something more modern and flexible just to name a few `[1] <https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/>`__ .  Apart
from the recently published security advisories (see patch notes below),
we have included a quick navigation feature which can be activated by
pressing (TAB) followed by search keywords and hitting (ENTER) to go to
the desired page.  Last but not least, a larger batch of improvements
and fixes went into assorted sections of the GUI that certainly help
to get your work done without ending up dazed and confused.

Speaking of clearing things up, there is more...  While Ad, Franco
and a couple of amazing external contributors have been busy writing
and reviewing code, Jos worked in the shadows to bring to you a fully
revised set of project documentation in the form of an online
handbook `[2] <https://docs.opnsense.org/>`__ .  More content will follow as we slow down development
speed a bit in order to catch up.  We will have to see how that works
out.  ;)

Another thing we have noticed is that translations are hard!  We have
planned to finish a translation for this iteration, but the sheer
amount of work overwhelmed even the sizeable German translation team.
The German translation is now at 77% percent completed with Japanese,
Chinese and French chasing tails.  If you want to help drop us a line
at project@opnsense.org for details on how to contribute.

All images have been pushed as well, although may take a bit more time
to reach a mirror near you.  You can find the checksums attached at the
end of this announcement.

16.1.20 (July 22, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


We are pushing out 16.1.20 a little earlier than expected to fix a
GUI regression that can affect users with IPv6.  Sorry about that.

Since this is the last 16.1 series release, the firmware page offers
an overview of migration hints for the 16.7 series.  We are expecting
to be right on schedule, namely July 28.  Oh, and by the way, the next
release will be called "Dancing Dolphin".

Here are the full patch notes:

* firmware: end-of-life announcement and preparation for 16.7 upgrade
* services: fix a missing dependency for the DHCPv6 service probing


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.1.19 (July 21, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It is time for a last full stable release before we offer our
16.1.20 end-of-life version, which then can be used to upgrade
to the 16.7 series.

Most changes presented today were either long-running development
additions for 16.7 or small reports that came up during the 16.7-RC
testing period.  Another prominent fix addresses an issue with
sporadic premature captive portal authentication timeouts that
one of our awesome forum members helped to debug.

16.1.16 (June 06, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It has been a long journey for HardenedBSD and OPNsense, and
finally the paths start to merge as the splendid and battle-
proven ASLR implementation gets incorporated into the default
installation!  It is just the beginning as we will start to
leverage the extra security by enabling position independent
execution in 16.7 and merge more security-related features.
We thank again the HardenedBSD team for their continued efforts
on making this world a safer place.

In other news, there is a thoroughly revamped dashboard for you
to enjoy and a handful of security fixes in FreeBSD and the ports
ecosystem.  LibreSSL has been updated to the latest production
release and the BETA version is progressing nicely as we change
our working mode from "rework all the things" to "polish all the
things".  A release candidate is coming up soon.

and welcome the cooperation between both projects on this one.
Way to go guys!

In other news, NTP and Bind were updated to their latest versions.
The gateway monitoring tool Apinger can now properly handle NTP
taking over time from time to time.  Er, anyway, language packs
will become pluggable in the long run and the MVC work for the
HAProxy plugin is now completely bundled with the release.  Plugin
release is currently scheduled for 16.1.14.

16.1.12 (April 27, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


How are you doing?  We have been doing fine, trying new things, moving
on further...  The progress for our upcoming version 16.7 now accumulates
to 3 full months.  To that end we are making the transition from ALPHA toi
BETA on the 16.7 development series.  And since we have been asked to
incorporate development change logs as well, look no further (well, look
below).

Anyway, 16.1.12 brings a handful of anticipated additions like FreeBSD's
package manager version 1.7.2 and the ability to use CoDel / FQ-Codel in
the traffic shaper.  We have also started to move services to the plugin
framework instead of having them in the base installation.  And, maybe as
a last point, initial work for fixing the trusty apinger utility for
gateway monitoring has surfaced.

Here is the full change log for 16.1.12:

* ports: pkg 1.7.2 `[1] <https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/commit/aabba637e>`__  `[2] <https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/commit/d3e9dc5ee>`__  `[3] <https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/commit/057fbfc94b>`__ , sqlite 3.12.1 `[4] <https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_12_1.html>`__ , squid 3.5.17 `[5] <http://ftp.meisei-u.ac.jp/mirror/squid/squid-3.5-ChangeLog.txt>`__

16.1.11 (April 18, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


We are skipping a bit ahead with 16.1.11 to address a CSRF vulnerability,
which outlines the path we have been on since we started `[1] <https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=2837.0>`__  and we will
surely continue this security-aware trend.

In other news, this update includes native GeoIP alias support, captive
portal voucher customisations requested by many and the last batch of
Russian, effectively bringing it to 100% completed.  Wow!

Here is the full change log:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It has been a quite uneventful week.  Suricata and Squid have been
upgraded to their latest versions and you can find their individual
change logs below.  The next part of the Russian translation brings
it to number one with a dreamy 83% completed.  Otherwise only small
fixes and improvements have been made and those will not even require

16.1.9 (April 08, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


We expect all of you are doing well?  It has been a longer while
since the last update so 16.1.9 has got a bit of everything to
keep the spirits high.  :)

There is tremendous progress in the translations.  It just so
happens that we now have a comprehensive Russian translation as
well which is going to be completed in the upcoming weeks.  Many
thanks to Smart-Soft for making this happen.  The contender
is Japanese through the work of Chie Taguchi, who did most of the
translation that we have had for a year.  It is going to be a
close race to the finish line for both languages.  Then again,
the whole translation team is doing an amazing job.

As polarising as it may be, we have added HTTPS support in the
proxy server.  Another noteworthy item is StrongSwan 5.4.0, which
helps to address IPSec status page hangs that some have observed
with complex setups.  We are looking for feedback for these items,
please do write in.

Here are the full patch notes:

* src: tzdata updated to 2016c `[1] <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz-announce/2016-March/000037.html>`__

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.1.8 (May 23, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This quick 16.1.8 is not a big update, but it means a lot.  We have
finished our full sweep of the GUI to update the look and feel of all
pages and made the code ready for what is to come now: new features
that are on our roadmap for 16.7.  The first one will be the HTTPS
proxy, but there is also NetFlow and improved statistics / reporting
on the shortlist.

A day after 16.1.7 was out last week, FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE-p14 was
announced.  Of the four patches enclosed, the two Hyper-V patches we
have already brought to OPNsense over a month ago, the OpenSSH patch
does not apply since we only use the port and already had it up-to-date.
That leaves us with only one patch that we are shipping now to complete
the experience.

Attention to everyone using OpenVPN + cryptodev acceleration: the
cryptodev module along with older crypto drivers has been removed
from the kernel itself, which means that if you need to keep using
it, go to System: Settings: Misc and reconfigure your crypto hardware
including an enable of cryptodev usage.

The refreshed images for 16.1 (based on 16.1.8) have been pushed to
the mirrors.  You can find the checksums attached at the end of this
announcement.

16.1.7 (March 16, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Time for a quick update!  We are still polishing our non-MVC GUI pages
to match the modern style of the MVC equivalents and fix a few minor
bugs along the way.  In these matters, we ask for your participation in
critically reviewing the changes below in order to catch remaining
issues as soon as possible.  We expect to finish our full code sweep
next week.  After that we will shift focus to work on new features.

The upgrades from 15.7.25 to 16.1.x briefly stalled with 16.1.6 due to
a dormant incompatibility in the FreeBSD package management tool after
flipping from 10.1 to 10.2, so we went ahead and made it all better.
More precaution in our own update tools will hopefully prevent such
unwanted breakage in the future, but we understand that these things
can slip through. :)

New images are on the way shortly after 16.1.8.  We are also introducing
the new "opnsense-stable" firmware path and some cool upgrade features
for our brave testers.  More explanations will follow soon.

Here are the full patch notes:

* ports: pecl-radius 1.3.0 `[1] <https://pecl.php.net/package-changelog.php?package=radius>`__ , bind 9.10.3-P4 `[2] <https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01363/81/BIND-9.10.3-P4-Release-Notes.html>`__ , bsnmp-ucd 0.4.2 `[3] <https://github.com/trociny/bsnmp-ucd/blob/master/CHANGELOG>`__ , openssh 7.2p2 `[4] <http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.2p2>`__ , sqlite 3.11.1 `[5] <https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_11_1.html>`__

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.1.6 (March 09, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It is update time!  This time around, DHCP and DNS have been freshened up
thoroughly, removing both potential and real problems from the GUI and
underneath.  Additionally, the proxy server gained ICAP support and a
category-based remote block list selection.

Our firmware mirror support has finally been extended so that it is now
possible to pull all updates from a single mirror, which will very soon
make it possible to run a local mirror for your internal installations.
We are also shipping the original FreeBSD OpenSSL patch, although the
security issues cannot not surface on OPNsense.  We just like to be
thorough.

Here are the full patch notes:

* src: Fix multiple vulnerabilities of OpenSSL `[1] <https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/7d8d4cb5>`__ 
* src: update tzdata to 2016a `[2] <http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz-announce/2016-January/000035.html>`__

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.1.5 (March 02, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It pleases us to say that although we ship the latest OpenSSL 1.0.2g today,
we have had both SSv2 and SSv3 support disabled in our installation for a
long while, so older installations are also not affected by yesterday's
announcement.  On a slightly related note, LibreSSL was not affected at all.

With that out of the way, we also happily let you know that we are shipping
RFC 4638 support with this stable release.  We also push a fix for an
upstream bug in Unbound and update Squid to the latest version... again. ;)

We have also announced the roadmap for 16.7.  Take a look at our upcoming
milestones:

https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/

And now, here are the full patch notes:

* ports: squid 3.5.15 `[1] <http://ftp.meisei-u.ac.jp/mirror/squid/squid-3.5-ChangeLog.txt>`__ , unbound 1.5.7 hotfix `[2] <https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/bugs-script/show_bug.cgi?id=729>`__ , pkg 1.6.4 hotfix `[3] <https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/1394>`__ ,

* ntp: disable when no servers are set
* language: updates for Chinese, French and German



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.1.4 (February 24, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


We pop in for a short stable update, namely 16.1.4.  Squid has been
updated to 3.5.14 and received a GUI entry for maximum_object_size
to define since the default has been reported as a wee bit too small.

In other news, the final roadmap for 16.7 will be unveiled later this
week after much internal discussion.  Our main goals are to finish a
full code audit, further alignment with FreeBSD and a few tiny
surprises.  Stay tuned for those.  :)

Here are the full patch notes:

* ports: squid 3.5.14 `[1] <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/SQUID_3_5_14.html>`__

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.1.3 (February 17, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It is time for a smaller update to 16.1.3.  There is another fix for our
Hyper-V users, the health section finally received its CPU temperature
graph and a few ports have been updated to their latest version.  Nothing
of particular interest happened, no issues with glibc from our side today.  :)

A number of assorted issues have been flushed from the code thanks to good
use of the crash reporter.  A special thank you goes to those of you who
submit email addresses and a brief description along with the report.  For
us it is tremendously useful to get as many details as possible and to
verify that our fixed work reliably in a particular use cases before
shipping them.

Enough with the announcing already, here are the full patch notes:

* src: hyperv/kvp: wake up the daemon if it is sleeping due to poll() `[1] <https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues/748>`__

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.1.2 (February 05, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It is time for a swift update for our dear Hyper-V users.  There is a
packet forwarding regression in FreeBSD 10.2 that has not been added
as errata yet so we had to pin it down with the help of three brave
testers.  If you happen to want to run Hyper-V without going through
the issue, install from an older 15.7 image and upgrade directly to
avoid the bad version.

To improve upon Suricata 3.0 and the SSL fingerprint lists we are now
enabling users to add user-defined rules for adding and enforcing their
own fingerprints.  But wait, that is not all.  On top of that the IP
geolocation feature was added as well while at it.  :)

Otherwise, only smaller bugs have been addressed to make 16.1 look
even shinier.  The FreeBSD security advisory for OpenSSL got integrated
too, but is not of much concern since we consistently use the ports
version for our components.  The important fixes have been shipped
with version 16.1.1 back on Monday.

Here are the full patch notes:

* src: OpenSSL SSLv2 ciphersuite downgrade vulnerability `[1] <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:11.openssl.asc>`__ 
* src: Fix packet forwarding in Hyper-V netvsc driver `[2] <https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=203630>`__ 
* src: Honour disabled pf(4) log flag on dropped packets with IP options `[3] <https://reviews.freebsd.org/D3222>`__

* wizard: fix certificate generation for OpenVPN
* firewall: fix interface selection on post issues in floating rules
* firewall: make category filter multi-select for maximum convenience
* firewall: do not hide gateways from the gateway selection
* firewall: added null routes to the gateway selection
* firewall: rather than hiding associated nat rules, remove their edit
  and clone buttons so they can still be deleted manually
* dns resolver: fix $numprocs setting in config according to manual
* dns resolver: do not render illegal output for empty IPv6 addresses
* dhcp: applying static mappings with DNS resolver enabled no longer
  seems stuck in apply step
* search: resize box on focus and also propagate proxy server tabs
* system: fix inversion bug of the default pass logging setting
* captive portal: properly log messages to associated log file
* intrusion detection: can now add user rules based on SSL fingerprints
  and IP geolocation



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.1.1 (February 02, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today we are following up on the OpenSSL advisories.  LibreSSL was not
affected (surprise, surprise), but received a tiny fix to sync up with
the deprecation of the high-severity SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE option of its
sibling.

In other news, we are shipping a few minor fixes along with all-new
SSL-centric rulesets for the intrusion prevention courtesy of abuse.ch `[3] <https://www.abuse.ch/>`__ .

16.1 (January 28, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


No, we would not say it was easy getting here, but booting into 16.1
for the first time sure is as relieving (and exciting) as it could get
for our project growing beyond what we had ever imagined.  It has been
more than a year since OPNsense first came out.  Back then it was
FreeBSD 10.0.  Not even two months after, 10.1 was introduced along
with the opnsense-update utility.  Today is the day for FreeBSD 10.2,
the latest and greatest release currently available for broader driver
support and stability improvements.

16.1 is nicknamed "Crafty Coyote" in honour of our beloved childhood
TV sessions.  It is the accumulation of 6 months of work, having had
our focus on reengineering the captive portal, native intrusion
prevention, plugin support, and transforming the reporting frontend
into something more modern and flexible just to name a few `[1] <https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/>`__ .  Apart
from the recently published security advisories (see patch notes below),
we have included a quick navigation feature which can be activated by
pressing (TAB) followed by search keywords and hitting (ENTER) to go to
the desired page.  Last but not least, a larger batch of improvements
and fixes went into assorted sections of the GUI that certainly help
to get your work done without ending up dazed and confused.

Speaking of clearing things up, there is more...  While Ad, Franco
and a couple of amazing external contributors have been busy writing
and reviewing code, Jos worked in the shadows to bring to you a fully
revised set of project documentation in the form of an online
handbook `[2] <https://docs.opnsense.org/>`__ .  More content will follow as we slow down development
speed a bit in order to catch up.  We will have to see how that works
out.  ;)

Another thing we have noticed is that translations are hard!  We have
planned to finish a translation for this iteration, but the sheer
amount of work overwhelmed even the sizeable German translation team.
The German translation is now at 77% percent completed with Japanese,
Chinese and French chasing tails.  If you want to help drop us a line
at project@opnsense.org for details on how to contribute.

All images have been pushed as well, although may take a bit more time
to reach a mirror near you.  You can find the checksums attached at the
end of this announcement.
