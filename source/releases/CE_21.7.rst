21.7  "Noble Nightingale" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 6 and a half years, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable
firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption of upstream software
updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

21.7, nicknamed "Noble Nightingale", is one of the largest iterations of
code changes in our recent history.  It will also be the last release on
HardenedBSD 12.1.  We are planning to start the work on FreeBSD 13 as soon
as next week for the 22.1 series.

The installer was replaced to offer native ZFS installations and prevent
glitches in virtual machines using UEFI.  Firmware updates were partially
redesigned and the UI layout consolidated between static and MVC pages.
The live log now contains the actual rule ID to avoid mismatches after
adjusting your ruleset and the firewall aliases now also support wildcard
netmasks.  For a complete list of changes see below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


End-of-the-year security and reliability update coming right up!

Due to inconclusive reports we are disabling the Netmap API version 14
support in Suricata to get a better understanding of the situation.
The plan still is to keep it for the 22.1 upgrade and it has in fact been

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.7.5 (November 11, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


FreeBSD security advisories and an issue with Intel-based ixgbe driver
with "ifconfig -v" stalls keep this release rolling.  Also note that
OpenSSH was updated to version 8.8 which deprecates ssh-rsa usage which
is mainly an issue for client access from the OPNsense system to the
outside and can be amended as per the suggestions in the respective
release notes.

And as promised the development version includes the upgrade path to
the 22.1-BETA1 release.  This will be an online-beta with a few iterations
over the FreeBSD 13 stable branch and eventually move to FreeBSD 13.1
release as that becomes available.

Highlights for 22.1 already include:

* Suricata Netmap version 14 support for multi-gigabit speed in IPS mode with RSS enabled
* Separate VLAN MAC spoofing and permanent promiscuous mode setting
* Tunable analytics provide automatic descriptions and type
* IPsec tunnel overview ported to MVC with pagination
* Proofpoint Emerging Threats rules for Suricata 5.0
* Removed opportunistic interface address read functions
* Console-based LAGG configuration support
* Removed state killing on gateway failure feature
* Improved firmware update capabilities
* No-bind service awareness for virtual IPs
* FreeBSD 13 stable branch
* RFC 5424 and severity support in logs
* Clog support has been removed
* And more...

Please note that the beta version will always be available for upgrade when
switching to the development version.  At this point no stable packages
are provided and this includes plugins.  These will become available as
the release candidate is released in early January 2022.

All feedback is welcome but keep in mind that there are still a number of
moving parts ahead.  Upgrade responsibly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.7.4 (October 27, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update features three new major things: optional receive side scaling
(RSS) support in the kernel, asynchronous DNS resolving for aliases and
configuration support for advanced LAGG settings.

RSS is disabled by default but may be switched on by adding a tunable
"net.inet.rss.enabled" with value "1" and rebooting the system.  While
RSS can improve performance for certain hardware it should be used with
care at this point and is not generally recommended yet!  The Suricata
version bundled with the development release offers the upcoming API
bindings to take advantage of the RSS-based multithreading.  Also please
note that PPPoE cannot take advantage of RSS.

On the side we are almost ready for our 22.1-BETA preview with rolling
releases for the development release type which is something new to look
forward to also.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: prevent expired or intermediate CA certificates from being added to trust store by default

21.7.3 (September 22, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This release finally brings in Suricata version 6 as well as OpenVPN tls-crypt
support, automatic user creation on LDAP-based logins and more.

As a general note the Realtek vendor driver currently bundled with the base
system will be moved to a plugin-based kernel module in version 22.1 and the
original re(4) driver inside FreeBSD 13 will be restored.  To ease migration
and because the version maintained in FreeBSD ports actually offers additional
fixes we have included the new plugin into this build.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: allow automatic user creation on LDAP-based logins
* interfaces: add and use unified function is_interface_assigned() to prevent deleting assigned interfaces
* interfaces: sync firewall groups after internal create/destroy operations
* interfaces: add netstat tree search and improve page layout
* interfaces: replace opportunistic diagnostics IP address lookups with more robust variants
* firewall: clarify match/set priority in rules
* firewall: improve alias description/preview
* firewall: aliases maximum entries progress bar
* dhcp: add shared dhcpd_leases() reader and use it in both lease pages
* openvpn: use is_interface_assigned() to prevent deletion of assigned instances
* openvpn: CARP status read cleanups (contributed by vnxme)
* openvpn: tls-crypt support (contributed by vnxme)

21.7.2 (September 07, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today the following CVEs are being addressed:

CVE-2021-3711, CVE-2021-3712, CVE-2021-23840, CVE-2021-23841

Please note that the Let's Encrypt client plugin is now called
ACME client since acme.sh version 3 does support multiple providers.

Apart from the usual batch of fixes the work on RSS (receive side
scaling) is progressing and groundwork has already made it to the
kernel along with the libnetmap library for allowing better scaling
in netmap mode along with it.  At this point, however, RSS is not
yet enabled and there is no impact on existing setups.  That will
likely change with one of the next stable versions in this series.

On the other hand, the work for FreeBSD 13 migration in 22.1 is
ongoing as well to be able to test this rather sooner than later.
In this iteration we will take the time to look at shared forwarding
edge cases and have already upstreamed a number of patches that
have been accumulated over the last couple of years to keep our
code base light and tidy.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: default RSS widget feed to forum announcements
* system: add missing ACL for Syslog targets page

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.7.1 (August 04, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


After some initial trouble with particular Intel network card instability
and two installer shortcomings this brings the first round of stable
updates, general improvements and even new features.

The OpenVPN integration required a few more changes for the 2.5 series
and Unbound would stall when the new cache restore feature was caching
an empty response.

Images have been reissued based on this version as well.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: relax server certificate check for web GUI validation
* system: use ifinfo counters instead of pfctl in interface widget
* interfaces: packet capture quick select for all interfaces
* firewall: make sure net.pf.request_maxcount and table-entries are always aligned
* firewall: only set state options on rules when state is being tracked
* firmware: fix opnsense-code pull when ABI configuration is no longer there
* firmware: fix upgrade with multiple repositories enabled
* firmware: sync plugins in console update
* firmware: revoke 21.1 fingerprint
* installer: fix possible hang when scanning for disks
* installer: fix multiple disk selection
* openvpn: fix genkey format on 2.5
* openvpn: improve the cipher parsing
* openvpn: untie server-ipv6 from server directive
* openvpn: return empty list when /api/openvpn/export/accounts/ is called without parameters
* unbound: reject invalid cache data
* unbound: automatically add "do-not-query-localhost: no" on DoT when needed
* unbound: support insecure-domain directive
* mvc: bring back bind_textdomain_codeset() to fix possible faulty page rendering

21.7 (July 28, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 6 and a half years, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable
firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption of upstream software
updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

21.7, nicknamed "Noble Nightingale", is one of the largest iterations of
code changes in our recent history.  It will also be the last release on
HardenedBSD 12.1.  We are planning to start the work on FreeBSD 13 as soon
as next week for the 22.1 series.

The installer was replaced to offer native ZFS installations and prevent
glitches in virtual machines using UEFI.  Firmware updates were partially
redesigned and the UI layout consolidated between static and MVC pages.
The live log now contains the actual rule ID to avoid mismatches after
adjusting your ruleset and the firewall aliases now also support wildcard
netmasks.  For a complete list of changes see below.

Download links, an installation guide `[1] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html>`__  and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.

21.7.r1 (July 07, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 6 and a half years, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable
firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption of upstream software
updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.  <3
