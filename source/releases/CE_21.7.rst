===========================================================================================
21.7  "Noble Nightingale" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 6 and a half years, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable
firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption of upstream software
updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

21.7, nicknamed "Noble Nightingale", is one of the largest iterations of
code changes in our recent history.  It will also be the last release on
HardenedBSD 12.1.  We are planning to start the work on FreeBSD 13 as soon
as next week for the 22.1 series.

The installer was replaced to offer native ZFS installations and prevent
glitches in virtual machines using UEFI.  Firmware updates were partially
redesigned and the UI layout consolidated between static and MVC pages.
The live log now contains the actual rule ID to avoid mismatches after
adjusting your ruleset and the firewall aliases now also support wildcard
netmasks.  For a complete list of changes see below.

Download links, an installation guide `[1] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html>`__  and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.
