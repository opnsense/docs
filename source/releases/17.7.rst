===========================================================================================
17.7  "Free Fox" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than two and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We are writing to you today to announce the final release of version
17.7, nicknamed "Free Fox", which, over the course of the last 6 months,
includes highlights such as SafeStack application hardening, the Realtek
re(4) driver for better network stability, a Quagga plugin with broad routing
protocol support and the Unbound resolver as the new default.  Additionally,
translations for Czech, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and German have been
completed for the first time during this development cycle.

Focus in OPNsense has shifted to improving and streamlining its various
systems and providing continuous updates, which amounts to over 300
individual changes made since 17.1 so far.  The plugin infrastructure is
growing as well thanks to our awesome contributors Frank Wall, Frank
Brendel, Fabian Franz and Michael Muenz.  And we, last but not least,
have been working more closely than ever with HardenedBSD by unifying
our ports infrastructure.

17.7.12 (January 18, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


As 18.1 is drawing near this stable update for the 17.7 series could be
the last one.  So whether there will be a hotfix to enable the update path
or a full 17.7.13 remains to be seen, but we will keep you informed either
way.  The targeted release date for 18.1 is January 29.

For now we refrain from letting users upgrade directly to the release
candidates, but suffice to say that with the development version

17.7.7 (October 26, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


OpenSSH is being updated to version 7.6, which means this change breaks
compatibility with SSH protocol version 1 and refuses RSA keys smaller
than 1024 bits.  Ideally, none of this should matter in a security-aware
deployment, but it is safer to double-check before the upgrade.

A new plugin for the Telegraf agent was released and we have reworked the
GeoIP alias configuration to be less cumbersome.  We would like to thank
everyone for the steady stream of ideas and constructive discussion and
ask for more!

The 18.1-BETA call for testing will be out in the next 24 hours as well
for all enthusiasts who want to test-drive the change from FreeBSD 11.0
to 11.1.  It has been an unconventional development cycle and this time
around there will be no images until 18.1-RC in late December or January.

And here are the full patch notes:

* firewall: GeoIP alias edit UX rework
* reporting: increase database timeout to 60 seconds
* firmware: add server in Frankfurt, DE courtesy of ieji.de
* firmware: base / kernel lock API
* firmware: details dialog for plugins
* firmware: assorted minor UI tweaks
* dhcp: improve sorting of DHCP leases (contributed by Larry Meaney)
* ipsec: add rightsourceip = %radius for eap-radius
* ipsec: moved firewall rule generation to plugin code
* web proxy: remove default value of visible_hostname
* mvc: translate navigation tabs (contributed by Alexander Shursha)
* mvc: prevent faulty child node removal in serializeToConfig()
* plugins: os-freeradius 1.2.0 adds EAP-TLS support (contributed by Michael Muenz)
* plugins: os-intrusion-detection-content-snort-vrt 1.0 (contributed by shonjir)
* plugins: os-telegraf 1.0 for amd64 only (contributed by Michael Muenz)

What a KRACKing week it has been!  In order to move past the WPA2 attacks
we have updated hostapd and wpa_supplicant to their latest version 2.6
including the released security fixes.  If you use wireless devices you
are advised to reboot to properly reload all wireless services.

In more positive news, plugins for Web Proxy SSO support and Siproxd have
been publicly released with this version.  Additionally, multi-remote
OpenVPN client configurations are now easily possible via the GUI.  We
also thank Fabian Abplanalp and HiHo.ch for providing a mirror in Switzerland.

We also are happy to announce the immediate availability of the renewed
OPNsense 17.7 images based on version 17.7.5.  Apart from the numerous
improvements since the initial release, the images contain an addition
for single interfaces SSH installer scenarios as well as an PPPoE multi-AP
kernel patch.  And due to popular demand the dynamic DNS plugin now comes
preinstalled, something we missed in the original 17.7 plugin conversion
process.

For almost 3 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through modularising
and hardening the code base, quick and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-
language support, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as
clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

Another week, another update.  Most notably, the Tor plugin has been

For more than two and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear

We are writing to you today to announce the final release of version
17.7, nicknamed "Free Fox", which, over the course of the last 6 months,
includes highlights such as SafeStack application hardening, the Realtek
re(4) driver for better network stability, a Quagga plugin with broad routing
protocol support and the Unbound resolver as the new default.  Additionally,
translations for Czech, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and German have been
completed for the first time during this development cycle.

Focus in OPNsense has shifted to improving and streamlining its various

17.7.r1 (July 14, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than two and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We are writing to you today to announce the first release candidate for
version 17.7, which, over the course of the last 5 months, includes
highlights such as SafeStack application hardening, the Realtek re(4)
driver for network stability, a Quagga plugin with broad routing protocol
support and the Unbound resolver as the new default.  Additionally,
translations for Czech, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and German have
been completed during this iteration.

Focus in OPNsense has shifted to improving and streamlining its various
systems and providing continuous updates, which amounts to over 300
individual changes made since 17.1 so far.  The plugin infrastructure is
growing as well thanks to our awesome contributors Frank Wall, Frank
Brendel, Fabian Franz and Michael Muenz.  And we, last but not least,
have been working more closely than ever with HardenedBSD by unifying
our ports infrastructure.  Although this is only the beginning, let us
not skip ahead.

Here is the full (and surprisingly sparse) list of changes against
version 17.1.9:

* system: added swap file option for SSD deployments
* system: bring back crash reports for all types of kernel crashes
* system: LDAP server StartTLS connection mode (contributed by Eugen Mayer)
* system: prevent anonymous binds to AD by rejecting empty passwords
* console: rewrote the backup restore to fix a possible licensing issue
* interfaces: instead of renaming new interfaces create them with the target name
* interfaces: the IP renewal was redesigned to prevent spurious reloads
* firewall: gateway code refactored
* firewall: rule generation code refactored
* dynamic dns: removed from core, installable as plugin
* rfc 2136: removed from core, installable as plugin
* ipsec: removed stale BINAT configuration items
* proxy: hardened the SSL configuration (contributed by Fabian Franz)
* src: netgraph/pppoe: user-supplied Host-Uniq tag and PADM messages

The list of currently known issues with 17.7-RC1:

* WLAN devices cannot be created.  A patch exists `[2] <https://github.com/opnsense/core/commit/5cb149d>`__  to remedy this problem.
* LAGG device destroy may cause a kernel panic.  A patch currently in testing.
* The installer identifies itself as 17.1.

As always with our pre-releases, only OpenSSL is provided at this point,
but can be switched for LibreSSL as soon as the release is available.
This release candidate does update directly into the 17.7 stable track
and subsequent release candidates.  Please let us know about your experience!
