===========================================================================================
18.1  "Groovy Gecko" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 3 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as
clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We humbly present to you the sum of another major iteration of the
OPNsense firewall.  Over the second half of 2017 well over 500 changes
have made it into this release, nicknamed "Groovy Gecko".  Most notably,
the firewall NAT rules have been reworked to be more flexible and usable
via plugins, which is going to pave the way for subsequent API works on
the core firewall functionality.  For more details please find the attached
list of changes below.

The upgrade track from 17.7 will be available later today.  Please be
patient.  :)

Meltdown and Spectre patches are currently being worked on in FreeBSD `[1] <https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-security/2018-January/009719.html>`__ ,
but there is no reliable timeline.  We will keep you up to date through
the usual channels as more news become available.  Hang in there!

These are the most prominent changes since version 17.7:

* FreeBSD 11.1, PHP 7.1 and jQuery 3 migration
* Realtek vendor NIC driver version 1.94
* Portable NAT before IPsec support
* Local group restriction feature in OpenVPN and IPsec
* OpenVPN multi-remote support for clients
* Strict interface binding for SSH and web GUI
* Improved MVC tabs and general page layout
* Shared forwarding now works on IPv6, in conjunction with "try-forwarding" and improved reply-to multi-WAN behaviour
* Easy-to-use update cache support for Linux and Windows in web proxy
* Intrusion detection alert improvements and plugin support for new rulesets (ET Pro, Snort VRT)
* Revamped HAProxy plugin with introduction pages
* Moved interface selection to menu and quick search for firewall rules, DHCP and wireless status
* Alias backend rewrite for future extensibility
* Plugin-capable firewall NAT rules
* Migration of system routes UI and backend to MVC (also available via API)
* Reverse DNS support for insight reporting (also available via API)
* Fully rewritten firewall live log in MVC (also available via API)
* New plugins: zerotier, mdns-repeater, collectd, telegraf, clamav, c-icap, tor, siproxd, web-proxy-sso, web-proxy-useracl, postfix, rspamd, redis, iperf, arp-scan, zabbix-proxy, frr, node_exporter

18.1.9 (May 31, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update is going forward with a larger batch of firmware update
improvements that are important for 18.7 and beyond, addressing the
former lack of error handling, check for update speed and API check
capabilities for major upgrades.

Intrusion detection syslog behaviour changes slightly after a number
of good discussions, meaning that now syslog is always on, but fast
log alert info is steered by the former syslog option making the
option the best of both worlds and enabling future syslog export,
which is now also available in the development version.

Last but not least we want to mention the work done on allowing detached
UI development which is now included in the release.  For more information
check out the UI development tools `[1] <https://github.com/opnsense/ui_devtools>`__  that have been released alongside.

There is more preparation underway for 18.7, but that info will have to
wait as it eludes the context of this announcement.  Feel free to
frequently check the milestone progress in the forums `[2] <https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=8597.0>`__  in the meantime.

18.1.7 (May 03, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


It has been a while and judging by the extensive list of changes below
one can easily see why.  The impact footprint of this update, however,
is relatively small.  With this update we are also moving into the
18.7-BETA phase where avid users are invited to flip their release version
from production to development in the firmware GUI settings.

Extensive work has been done for DHCPv6 connectivity by the wonderful
folks of Team Rebellion, e.g. fixing the stale daemon issues that prevented
connectivity after reconfiguration.  OpenVPN was updated to version 2.4.6
and received a substantial server setup rejuventation to allow out of the
box IPv6 usage.  LibreSSL received a bump in order to correctly speed up
AESNI, something that was not working since its update to version 2.6.

Users of the web proxy with IDNA domains must take note that the previous
implementation was removed in favour of a less intrusive approach that
does not require encoding and decoding domain names in the configuration.
All domains are now stored verbatim and are only encoded during web proxy
runtime setup.  Formerly created and thus now wrongly encoded domains need
to be deleted and added back.  We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

* system: validate pfsync peer as IPv4-only

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
18.1.6 (April 09, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


With Meltdown and Spectre just behind us here comes another round of
security advisories and assorted changes.

Three mentionable changes are included: We are switching back to
single-source automatic outbound NAT on the primary IP instead of
using all additional VIPs on the interface as was the case with
OPNsense 17.7 and earlier.  The hardware-assisted VLAN capability
check was removed from the system enabling e.g. XEN users to create
VLANs.  And the multi-WAN traffic shaping experience has been
corrected for non-default interfaces within the scope of shared
forwarding.

Expected is an image release based on this version some time within
the next week for completeness.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: reverse reload order for gateway switching on OpenVPN
* system: implement password policies for local accounts
* system: separate web GUI and configd log files
* system: add syslog and login service visibility
* system: show root as disabled in user manager if disabled
* interfaces: no longer restrict VLAN driver capability
* firewall: switch back to the pre-18.1 auto-outbound NAT behaviour

18.1.5 (March 21, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today ships Meltdown and Spectre V2 mitigation for amd64, the latter only
effective with the corresponding microcode update.  However, the combating
of speculative execution security issues remains an ongoing quest for the
unforeseeable future.  To avoid surprises HardenedBSD has enabled Meltdown
mitigation (PTI) by default even for AMD CPUs who have not yet been found
vulnerable.  Performance impact is luckily minimal here, although the Spectre
V2 mitigation (IBRS) can slow down CPUs with the respective microcode updates
in place.

To opt out of one or both features, the following values can now be
persistently set under System: Settings: Tunables:

* Disable PTI via "vm.pmap.pti" to "0" and a reboot, and
* Disable IBRS via "hw.ibrs_disable" to "1" with a simple "Apply".

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: optional prefix Google Drive backups with host and domain name

18.1 (January 29, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 3 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as
clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We humbly present to you the sum of another major iteration of the
OPNsense firewall.  Over the second half of 2017 well over 500 changes
have made it into this release, nicknamed "Groovy Gecko".  Most notably,
the firewall NAT rules have been reworked to be more flexible and usable
via plugins, which is going to pave the way for subsequent API works on
the core firewall functionality.  For more details please find the attached
list of changes below.

The upgrade track from 17.7 will be available later today.  Please be
patient.  :)

Meltdown and Spectre patches are currently being worked on in FreeBSD `[1] <https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-security/2018-January/009719.html>`__ ,
but there is no reliable timeline.  We will keep you up to date through
the usual channels as more news become available.  Hang in there!

These are the most prominent changes since version 17.7:

* FreeBSD 11.1, PHP 7.1 and jQuery 3 migration
* Realtek vendor NIC driver version 1.94
* Portable NAT before IPsec support
* Local group restriction feature in OpenVPN and IPsec
* OpenVPN multi-remote support for clients
* Strict interface binding for SSH and web GUI
* Improved MVC tabs and general page layout
* Shared forwarding now works on IPv6, in conjunction with "try-forwarding" and improved reply-to multi-WAN behaviour
* Easy-to-use update cache support for Linux and Windows in web proxy
* Intrusion detection alert improvements and plugin support for new rulesets (ET Pro, Snort VRT)
* Revamped HAProxy plugin with introduction pages
* Moved interface selection to menu and quick search for firewall rules, DHCP and wireless status
* Alias backend rewrite for future extensibility
* Plugin-capable firewall NAT rules
* Migration of system routes UI and backend to MVC (also available via API)
* Reverse DNS support for insight reporting (also available via API)
* Fully rewritten firewall live log in MVC (also available via API)
* New plugins: zerotier, mdns-repeater, collectd, telegraf, clamav, c-icap, tor, siproxd, web-proxy-sso, web-proxy-useracl, postfix, rspamd, redis, iperf, arp-scan, zabbix-proxy, frr, node_exporter

18.1.r1 (January 11, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 3 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as
clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We humbly present to you the sum of another major iteration of the
OPNsense firewall.  Over the second half of 2017 well over 500 changes
have made it into this first release candidate.  Most notably, the
firewall NAT rules have been reworked to be more flexible and usable
via plugins, which is going to pave the way for subsequent API works
on the core firewall functionality.  For more details please find the
attached list of changes below.

Meltdown and Spectre patches are currently being worked on in FreeBSD `[1] <https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-security/2018-January/009719.html>`__ ,
but there is no reliable timeline.  We will keep you up to date through
the usual channels as more news become available.  Hang in there!
