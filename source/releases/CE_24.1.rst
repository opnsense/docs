24.1  "Savvy Shark" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 9 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

24.1, nicknamed "Savvy Shark", features ports-based OpenSSL 3, Suricata 7,
several MVC/API conversions, a new neighbor configuration feature for ARP/NDP,
core inclusion of the os-firewall and os-wireguard plugins, CARP VHID tracking
for OpenVPN and WireGuard, functional Kea DHCPv4 server with HA support plus
much more.

24.1.10 (July 11, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today a number of security advisories in third party software are being
addressed.  Also, a bad dhcp6c patch has been reverted which requires
a manual reboot to take full effect.

CAUTION: The OpenSSH update prevents SSH sessions from being established.
You need to restart OpenSSH from the GUI or run the console command
"pluginctl -s openssh restart" or reboot the system in order to unbreak it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24.1.6 (April 18, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today we are happy to announce another milestone regarding ISC DHCP removal:
the arrival of a DHCRelay replacement based on code forked and maintained
by OpenBSD.  While here the whole DHCP relay section was moved to MVC/API
for the usual reasons and now offers a combined GUI for both DHCPv4 and
DHCPv6 relay.  As a special treat this also includes being able to run
ISC DHCP as well as any desired relay at the same time.

The feedback for the WireGuard peer generator was quite extensive so a few
more tweaks and fixes have been done in that area.  Thank you for all the
responses regarding that feature addition!

Otherwise this update simply moves ahead with security-related third
party updates in OpenSSL and PHP.

Last but not least we are releasing the OPNProxy (formerly business) plugin
to the community version for fine-grained access control using Squid with
Redis as a database backend.  For more details please consult the available
documentation linked below.

Here are the full patch notes:

* firewall: show automation rules in their own section
* firewall: keep permissions to standard for filter.lock file
* firewall: replace searchNoCategoryItemAction() with new searchBase() extension
* firewall: add gateway to the states diagnostics output
* firewall: fix visible rows quantity off-by-one (contributed by NYOB)
* intrusion detection: query all fields for searchBase() actions
* dhcrelay: functional MVC/API replacement using the OpenBSD dhcrelay(6) fork
* isc-dhcp: fix log file location
* wireguard: add DNS field to peer generator and store previous used values in instance
* wireguard: add address field to peer generator which auto-calculates the next available address in the pool
* wireguard: add restart action to available cron tasks (contributed by Michael Muenz)
* wireguard: unlink instance on peer delete
* mvc: extend searchBase() to return all fields when no list is provided
* mvc: fix config locking issue when already owning the lock
* plugins: add globbing for plugin run tasks as well

24.1.4 (March 20, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Suricata and Unbound have been updated to their latest versions.
Support for dynamic DNS VTI connections has also been added
amongst other things.

We would like to thank Cedrik Pischem (Monviech) for upstreaming his
Caddy plugin to the official packages.  If you already have this plugin
installed no further action has to be taken and updates should proceed
through the standard firmware channel from now on.  Documentation for it
was added to the manual as well.

For 24.7, we are currently working on a DHCP-Relay replacement,
a rewrite of the trust section in MVC as well as a new dashboard
implementation.  It has been busy and we will keep it that way.  :)

Here are the full patch notes:

24.1.3 (March 06, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update fixes minor issues in the software and adds a CSV import/export
to the Kea DHCP reservations to make bulk edits much easier.  It also fixes

24.1 (January 30, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 9 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

24.1, nicknamed "Savvy Shark", features ports-based OpenSSL 3, Suricata 7,
several MVC/API conversions, a new neighbor configuration feature for ARP/NDP,
core inclusion of the os-firewall and os-wireguard plugins, CARP VHID tracking
for OpenVPN and WireGuard, functional Kea DHCPv4 server with HA support plus
much more.

A hotfix release was issued as 24.1_1:

* ports: revert back to suricata 6.0.15 for the time being

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* Audits and certifications are requiring us to restrict system accounts for non-administrators (without wheel group in particular).  It will no longer be possible to use non-adminstrator accounts with shell access and permissions for sensitive files have been tightened to not be world-readable.  This may cause custom tooling to stop working, but can easily be fixed by giving these required accounts the full administration rights.
* ISC DHCP functionality is slowly being deprecated with the introduction of Kea as an alternative.  The work to replace the tooling of ISC DHCP is ongoing, but feature sets will likely differ for a long time therefore.
* The move to the FreeBSD ports version of OpenSSL 3.0 is included and may disrupt third party repository use until those have been fixed and rebuilt accordingly.  Please note that we do not vet third party repositories and do not have control over them so their response time may vary.
* The Squid web proxy functionality moves to a plugin and will no longer be installed by default for new installations.  However, if you have Squid enabled the plugin will automatically be installed during the upgrade.  There is no code difference in the implementation and integration of the plugin compared to the core version.
