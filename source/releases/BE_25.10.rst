for numerous aliases being used at once, OpenID Connect integration, captive
portal backend rewrite, Greek as a new language, FreeBSD 14.3 plus much more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.10.1 (December 10, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This business release is based on the OPNsense 25.7.8 community version
with additional reliability improvements, but without revamped Unbound
blocklists for the time being.

Please be aware that during the update check the new package manager will be
installed, but will fail to report the update status like it always had before
and so you will end up with an error that will require checking for updates
again.  The fix is in this update, but impossible to install without upgrading
the package manager first.  We hope this will only be a minor inconvenience
during the process.

Also, Python has reported security issues of which a DoS in http.client could
potentially affect existing installations given that an HTTP server sends
a malicious response which "can consume a large amount of memory and CPU time
and cause swapping".  Python has not released an update for version 3.11 at
this point in time.

A hotfix release was issued as 25.10_2:

* system: safeguard config history delete and revert by requiring HTTP POST method
* rc: make sure /var/lib/php/tmp can be accessed by "other" users
* plugins: os-OPNBEcore 1.7
* plugins: os-OPNcentral 1.12
* plugins: os-q-feeds-connector 1.2 `[43] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/qfeeds.html>`__  `[44] <https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/25.7/security/q-feeds-connector/pkg-descr>`__ 
* plugins: os-squid 1.4 works around CVE-2025-62168 (contributed by m.a.x. it)

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The captive portal implementation moves from IPFW to PF.  Check the technical details first, especially regarding the new ruleset behaviours. `[45] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/captiveportal.html>`__ 
* Deprecated Google Drive backups due to upstream policy changes and moved to plugins for existing users.
* API URLs registered in the default ACLs have been switched from "camelCase" to "snake_case".
* API grid return values now offer "%field" for a value description when available.  "field" will now always be the literal value from the configuration.  The API previously returned a display value for some field types, but not all.
* Reverted tunables "hw.ibrs_disable" and "vm.pmap.pti" to FreeBSD defaults when no explicit values have been set in tunables.
* Moved OpenVPN legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.
* Moved IPsec legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.
