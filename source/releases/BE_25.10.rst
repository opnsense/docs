* plugins: os-squid 1.4 works around CVE-2025-62168 (contributed by m.a.x. it)

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The captive portal implementation moves from IPFW to PF.  Check the technical details first, especially regarding the new ruleset behaviours. `[45] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/captiveportal.html#migration-notes-technical-details.html>`__ 
* Deprecated Google Drive backups due to upstream policy changes and moved to plugins for existing users.
* API URLs registered in the default ACLs have been switched from "camelCase" to "snake_case".
* API grid return values now offer "%field" for a value description when available.  "field" will now always be the literal value from the configuration.  The API previously returned a display value for some field types, but not all.
* Reverted tunables "hw.ibrs_disable" and "vm.pmap.pti" to FreeBSD defaults when no explicit values have been set in tunables.
* Moved OpenVPN legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.
* Moved IPsec legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.
