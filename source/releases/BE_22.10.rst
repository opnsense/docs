Known issues and limitations:

* The DH parameter is no longer available in OpenVPN server configuration and now fixed to the RFC 7919 4096 bit key.  The only downside may be lower performance on older machines.
* The infamous /var MFS feature was reduced to the /var/log scope in order to avoid future issues with plugins requiring persistent storage under /var.  In practice people who used /var MFS had no benefit over it with software that required persistent storage under /var to operate in the first place.  Periodic configuration file writes to /var are negligible on SSD-based systems.
* The os-dyndns plugin is still available due to the fact that ddclient did not release a non-development release so far since we started os-ddclient.  Availability thereof might change later in 22.7.x.
* The console firmware update will now display text-based changelogs for the update to be installed if available.  Use the arrow keys to scroll the changelog and type "q" to resume the update process.
* The manual DHCPv6 tracking mode now requires a proper prefix range given like its counterpart with a static address.  If a previous prefix ID type input is detected only setting the lower 64 bits of an IPv6 address, a warning is emitted and the ID is treated as the upper 64 bits of an IPv6 address instead.  If your DHCPv6 server does not start please properly fix the given range.
* Empty CRLs (System: Trust: Revocation) created prior to this version were not stored correctly.  This leads to non-working OpenVPN servers when these CLRs are used starting with this version.  To fix this prior to upgrading remove the empty CRL from OpenVPN, or add a dummy certificate to it to populate the CRL properly, or add and remove a random existing certificate to correct the empty CRL.
