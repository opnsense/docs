===========================================================================================
24.7  "Thriving Tiger" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 9 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

24.7, nicknamed "Thriving Tiger", features a new dashboard, system trust
MVC/API support, GRE and GIF MVC/API support, NAT 1-to-1 MVC/API support,
WireGuard QR code generator, dynamic IPsec VTI tunnel support, experimental
OpenVPN DCO support, FreeBSD 14.1, Python 3.11 plus much more.

The upgrade path from 24.1.x will follow tomorrow.  Do not be hasty.
The major operating system upgrade has not happened in while and should
be taken with the appropriate amount of care.

24.7.10 (December 03, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This ships a number of base system changes, kernel fixes and driver
updates.  The time-loop authentication change is back with the fixed
TOTP case and the Unbound domain overrides are now found in query
forwarding since this offers the same functionality anyway.

Please note we had to hotfix the kernel which will not reinstall
automatically if you caught the bad version.  If you experience
panics on 24.7.10 relating to pf(4) please reinstall from the GUI
(which includes an automatic reboot) or run "opnsense-update -fk"
from the shell followed by a manual reboot.  The correct kernel
identifies itself as "stable/24.7-n267981-8375762712f" using
"uname -v".

With the year almost over we are shifting focus to finishing the items
on the roadmap and it is nice to note that the MVC/API conversions are
already over 75% complete.  That means it will not take another decade
to migrate the other 25%.  ;)

24.7.9 (November 20, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a minor update that further tweaks the trust store integration
and firmware updates tying into it although in practice it does not
change the current behaviour from a user perspective.  If something is
not behaving as usual afterwards please let us know.

A new plugin has been added to finally allow proxying ND messages for
those people stuck on a single /64 prefix delegation.  Otherwise it
has been pretty quiet as you can see.  But we will be back soon.  ;)

24.7.6 (October 09, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


A few security and reliability issues this week.  Most notably Suricata
and Unbound.  The dashboard rework seems to be concluded now as the
ACL behaviour was aligned and should match the user expectation on
the "Lobby" section privileges.  Note not all widgets have separate
ACLs as it aims to provide a minimal safe selection of system widgets
associated with the access to the dashboard page in general.

We will, however, continue to improve the dashboard further while we
also tackle other interesting areas for 25.1.  That being said have
a look at the new roadmap `[1] <https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/>`__  we published recently.

You may notice the increased activity on the trust store side due to
our LINCE certification efforts.  Valuable feedback and code changes
have come from this process that will also find their way into other
related projects in the near future.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: do not render non-reachable dashboard widget links
* system: handle picture deletion via hidden input on general settings page
* system: straighten out API ACL entries for several components
* system: remove unreachable "page-getstats" ACL entry
* system: adjust "page-system-login-logout" ACL entry to be used as a minimal dashboard privilege
* system: deprecate the "page-dashboard-all" ACL entry as it will be removed in 25.1
* system: add descriptions on CA and certificate downloads file names
* system: show user icon when certificate is not otherwise used (in case CN matches any of our registered users)
* system: add proper validation when certificates are being imported via CSR
* system: add missing CRL changed event when CRLs are saved in the GUI
* system: add a trust settings page and move existing trust settings there as well
* system: optionally fetch and store CRLs attached to trusted authorities
* system: improve and extend certctl.py script doing the trust store rehashing
* system: enforce CRL behaviour for existing revocations in the trust store when doing remove syslog sending over TLS
* interfaces: simplify and clarify pfsync reconfiguration hooks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24.7.5 (September 26, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This release removes significant processing overhead from larger setups
due to being able to coalesce parallel configuration requests for the same
component instead of iterating over the list of selected interfaces one
by one.  A number of third party software updates and FreeBSD security
advisories are included as well.

This update also disables NUMA by default which can bring a boost in
network throughput on affected systems.  And of course we are still
working on dashboard improvements so now the treasured picture widget
is back with a better integration approach.

Also take note that the NTP default changes to "restrict noquery" so that
the system cannot externally be queried for revealing system internals
anymore unless explicitly allowed.

The technical stuff out of the way we would simply like to add that we
had a great time at EuroBSDCon in Dublin over the weekend.  Lots of good
and productive conversations.  Looking forward to more of those!  :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24.7.4 (September 12, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since we are currently having a vivid discussion about what constitutes
a downstream or upstream issue in the FreeBSD scope we will revert the
FreeBSD-SA-24:05.pf advisory until further notice.  As confirmed by many
users this brings ICMPv6 and therefore IPv6 back to an uneventful stable
state.  We will be trying to work with FreeBSD on the issue as it seems
unavoidable that we meet it again when working on FreeBSD 14.2 inclusion.

In other IPv6 news we found a strange regression in dhcp6c introduced in
24.7.2 and reverted the offending commits for now.  What this tells us,
though, is that we did uncover an inherent issue with the timeout value
generation that may be present since two decades in the code at least.

Apart from smaller fixes for the dashboard, trust pages, this update
also ships the first backwards-compatible PPP rework patch.  The ultimate
goal here is to offer IPv6-only connectivity which requires untangling
old code to be IP family agnostic.  Should you note any change in behaviour
please do not hesitate to contact us.

BTW, the roadmap for 25.1 has been decided and will be published soon.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: recover stuck monitors and offer a cron job
* system: use built-in controller logic for JSON decoding on dashboard
* system: map derivative field cert_type to expose purpose to the UI
* system: handle stale "pfsyncinterfaces" and improve workflow
* system: tweak the boot detection for code minimalism
* system: do not save x/y widget coordinates on smaller screens
* system: fix CARP widget on invalid CARP configuration
* system: fix storing private key when creating a CSR
* reporting: remove nonexistent 3G statistics
* interfaces: force regeneration of link-local on spoofed MAC
* interfaces: add proper validation for 6RD and 6to4
* interfaces: add new "vpn_map" event to deprecate "vpn"
* interfaces: unify PPP linkup/linkdown scripting
* interfaces: replace "newwanip" from interface apply with "early"
* interfaces: move IPv6 over IPv4 connectivity to a separate script
* interfaces: port VXLAN to newwanip_map event
* firewall: replace filter_(un)lock() with a FileObject lock
* isc-dhcp: allow to disable a DHCPv6 server with faulty settings
* firmware: remove auto-retry from fetch invokes
* firmware: allow auto-configure patching via full URL
* firmware: automatically handle most plugin conflicts
* openssh: convert to newwanip_map and rework the code

24.7.3 (August 29, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today we are switching pf stateful tracking of ICMPv6 neighbour discoveries
off in order to fix the previous instability with the FreeBSD security
advisory first shipped in 24.7.1.  We do this in order to provide the same
reliable IPv6 functionality that was on all previous versions prior to
24.7.1 at the cost of resurfacing CVE-2024-6640 until a better solution
has been devised.  A link to the long and difficult upstream bug report is
included below.

But that is not all.  The GUI gains snapshot support on ZFS installations by
implementing what is called "boot environments" which allows one to move
seamlessly from one snapshot to another via reboot.  This functionality can
also be accessed from the boot loader menu option "8" for a quick recovery
ensuring that at least one other snapshot was created to boot into.  A very
special thank you to Sheridan Computers for contributing this feature.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: add snapshots (boot environments) support via MVC/API (contributed by Sheridan Computers)
* system: remove obsolete dashboard sync
* system: compact services widget on dashboard
* system: convert lock mode to edit mode on dashboard
* system: link certificates by subject on import
* system: unify how log search clauses work and add a search time constraint
* system: move to static imports for widget base classes on dashboard
* system: fix ACL check on dashboard restore and add safety check for save action
* system: change dashboard modify buttons to a bootstrap group (contributed by Jaka Prašnikar)
* interfaces: add "newwanip_map" event and deprecate old "newwanip" one
* interfaces: keep 24.7 backwards compatibility by allowing 6RD and 6to4 on PPP
* interfaces: add logging to PPP link scripts to check for overlap
* interfaces: return correct uppercase interface name in getArp()
* interfaces: fix issue with PPP port not being posted
* dhcrelay: start on "newwanip_map" event as well
* intrusion detection: update the default suricata.yaml (contributed by Jim McKibben)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24.7.2 (August 21, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today a follow-up for the FreeBSD security advisory for pf/ICMP
ships that addresses the undesired traceroute behaviour.  A few
dashboard improvements are included as well as better IPv6 recovery
for dhcp6c and assorted stability fixes.

As a special note we now have native CPU microcode update plugins
for either AMD or Intel to install from the GUI.  Apart from a reboot
these plugins require no further user interaction and will keep the
applicable microcode at the latest known version as shipped in the
packages repository.

We are currently working on making PPP capable of running in
IPv6-only deployments; additionally ZFS snapshots (a.k.a boot environments)
are coming to the next stable release and can already be previewed in
the bundled development version.

Last but not least, an "importmap" free dashboard version is also
ready for testing in the development release.  We hereby ask for
feedback so that it can be included in a subsequent stable release.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: CRL import ignored text input and triggered unrelated validations
* system: improve the locking during web GUI restart
* system: improve WireGuard and IPsec widgets
* system: add CPU widget graph selection

24.7.1 (August 08, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This release includes a batch of dashboard changes due to the reliable
feedback we have received from you all so far.  There will be more dashboard
changes in the future mostly relating to UX and sane default behaviour
so just know we are aware.

A few smaller regressions due to the Phalcon module replacement efforts
have been fixed as well.  IPv6 behaviour has been adjusted for SLAAC and
the web GUI.

Last but not least we found and fixed a number of issues with FreeBSD 14.1
and are including its security advisories from yesterday while at it.

MVC/API conversions are already being carried out in the development version
and it seems that PPP-related connectivity will get a bigger makeover too.
The roadmap for 25.1 will be discussed and likely published later this month.

24.7 (July 25, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than 9 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

24.7, nicknamed "Thriving Tiger", features a new dashboard, system trust
MVC/API support, GRE and GIF MVC/API support, NAT 1-to-1 MVC/API support,
WireGuard QR code generator, dynamic IPsec VTI tunnel support, experimental
OpenVPN DCO support, FreeBSD 14.1, Python 3.11 plus much more.

The upgrade path from 24.1.x will follow tomorrow.  Do not be hasty.
The major operating system upgrade has not happened in while and should
be taken with the appropriate amount of care.

24.7.r1 (July 16, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you have not heard: 24.7-RC1 is an online update. You can update
from the 24.7-BETA and switch to the community release type for the
stable track which leads into 24.7.x.  The development version of the
upcoming 24.1.11 release will also be able to update to the RC. An RC2
will follow up with the relevant images and additional information at
the end of the week.

Here are the full changes against version 24.1.10:

* system: remove "load_balancer" configuration remnants from core
* system: replace usage of mt_rand() with random_int()
* system: rewrote Trust configuration using MVC/API
* system: add XMLRPC option for OpenDNS
* system: rewrote the high availability settings page using MVC/API
* system: remove obsolete SSH DSA key handling
* system: replaced the dashboard with a modern alternative with streaming widgets
* system: harden a number of PHP settings according to best practices
* system: support streaming of log files for the new dashboard widget
* interfaces: rewrote GRE configuration using MVC/API
* interfaces: rewrote GIF configuration using MVC/API
* interfaces: temporary flush SLAAC addresses in DHCPv6 WAN mode to avoid using them primarily
* interfaces: add peer/peer6 options to CARP VIPs
* interfaces: allow to assign a prefix ID to WAN interface in DHCPv6 as well
* interfaces: allow to set manual interface ID in DHCPv6 and tracking modes
* firewall: performance improvements in alias handling
* firewall: refactor pftop output, move search to controller layer and implement cache for sessions page
* firewall: support streaming of filter logs for the new dashboard widget
* captive portal: add "Allow inbound" option to select interfaces which may enter the zone
* captive portal: remove defunct transparent proxy settings
* captive portal: clean up the codebase
* ipsec: prevent gateway when remote gateway family does not match selected protocol in legacy tunnel configuration
* isc-dhcp: do not reload DNS services when editing static mappings to match behaviour with Kea
* monit: expose HTTPD username and password settings to GUI
* openvpn: optionally support DCO devices for instances
* openvpn: remove duplicate and irrelevant data for the client session in question
* openvpn: add "remote_cert_tls" option to instances
* backend: add "cache_ttl" parameter to allow for generic caching of actions
* backend: run default action "configd actions" when none was specified
* backend: extended support for streaming actions
* ui: assorted improvements for screen readers (contributed by Jason Fayre)
* ui: add "select all" to standard form selectors and remove dialog on "clear all" for tokenizers
* ui: lock save button while in progress to prevent duplicate input on Bootgrid
* ui: backport accessibility fix in Bootstrap
* mvc: replaced most of the Phalcon MVC use with a native band compatible implementation
* mvc: improve searchRecordsetBase() filtering capabilities
* mvc: improve container field cloning
* plugins: os-acme-client 4.4 `[1] <https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/24.7/security/acme-client/pkg-descr>`__ 
* plugins: os-etpro-telemetry 1.7 replaces dashboard widget
* src: FreeBSD 14.1-RELEASE `[2] <https://www.freebsd.org/releases/14.1R/relnotes/>`__ 
* ports: phalcon 5.8.0 `[3] <https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v5.8.0>`__ 

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The dashboard has been replaced. Widgets from the old format are no longer supported and need to be rewritten by the respective authors.
* ISC DHCP will no longer reload DNS services on static mapping edits. This is for feature parity with Kea DHCP and avoiding cross-service complications. If you expect your static mappings to show up in a particular DNS service please restart this service manually.

24.7.b (June 13, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since OPNsense 24.7 will be based on a newer FreeBSD major version
it is crucial for us to release these BETA images based on the latest
development state. This is not meant for production use but all plugins
are provided and future updates of installations based on these images
will be possible.

https://pkg.opnsense.org/releases/24.7/

There is a bit more work to be done yet most of the milestones have
already been reached. If you have a test deployment or would like to
check out some of the new features these images are for you. Together
we can make OPNsense better than it ever was.

The final release date for 24.7 is July 24.  A release candidate will
follow in early July.

Highlights over the current 24.1 series include:

* Dashboard replacement with streaming widgets
* System: High Availability: Settings page has been converted to MVC
* System: Trust section has been converted to MVC/API
* Interfaces: GIF section has been converted to MVC/API
* Interfaces: GRE section has been converted to MVC/API
* Firewall: NAT 1-to-1 has been converted to MVC/API
* Added experimental OpenVPN DCO device type support
* Added unicast CARP support to Virtual IPs
* DHCPv6 on WAN can now assign a prefix subnet to itself and support static interface identifiers
* Built-in cache capability for backend commands
* Captive portal backend refactor and new "Allow inbound interfaces" option
* Large portions of Phalcon MVC have been replaced by native PHP implementation
* FreeBSD 14.1

The public key for the 24.7 series is:
