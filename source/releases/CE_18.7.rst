18.7  "Happy Hippo" Series
===========================================================================================



For 3 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

Another 6 months passed by ever so quickly!  The main goal for 18.7,
nicknamed "Happy Hippo", is stability so we have not yet begun to adopt
FreeBSD 11.2, but there are several of its Intel NIC driver updates
included to bridge the gap until 19.1 comes out.  The upgrade also
includes a tremendous amount of IPv6 improvements including 6RD support
as well as authentication and backup framework consolidation.  Please
also take note that QinQ is no longer included in this release.

These are the most prominent changes since version 18.1:

* improved WAN DHCPv6 and SLAAC connectivity and tracking
* functional IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6RD) support
* improved default route handling and gateway switching
* OpenVPN default setup improvements for IPv6 and RADIUS attribute support
* Dpinger gateway monitoring integration
* password policies for local authentication and coupled TOTP
* Monit core integration to eventually replace the legacy notifications
* OpenSSH access via group and shell selection instead of privilege
* pluggable backup framework with new Nextcloud option
* sytem tunables are now also used as loader tunables
* unrestricted VLAN usage for e.g. Xen
* QinQ interface removal
* firmware GUI speedup, improved error parsing and console reboot hint
* ZFS on root boot support (installer support is pending, but opnsense-bootstrap works)
* ZFS and MSDOS config import support
* ISC DHCP version moves from 4.3 to 4.4
* RRDtool version moves from 1.2 to 1.7
* rework rc.syshook facility to use drop-in directories instead of suffixes
* backports of FreeBSD 11.2 Intel NIC drivers
* stand-alone frontend UI development tools
* language updates for Czech, French, German, Portuguese (Brazil)
* UI header security and SSL cipher hardening
* extensive UI cleanups and menu consolidation
* new and rewritten plugins: os-cache, os-lcdproc-sdeclcd, os-net-snmp,
  os-nut, os-openconnect, os-relayd 2.0, os-shadowsocks, os-theme-cicada,
  os-theme-rebellion, os-theme-tukan, os-wol 2.0

18.7.7 (November 08, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today we are addressing CVE-2018-18958 regarding an unenforced "deny
config write" privilege.  The issue was reported by brainrecursion this
Monday and subsequently fixed along with several related issues.  The
"deny config write" privilege coupled with admin or user and group manager
rights are affected combinations.  It is an uncommon way to configure
access as the "deny config write" privilege is commonly used for role-based
access to non-system services, e.g. captive portals.

As we cannot be sure that no further issues of this sort exist please
refrain from using the "deny config write" privilege or at least stop
giving access to system services or full admin rights to these users
or groups.  In the midterm we will be looking for replacements of the
current privilege for something that is more generic and robust in
enforcement.

Additionally, the update to Suricata 4.0.6 addresses the SMTP crash
vulnerability CVE-2018-18956.  Since the update does not reboot without
an operating system update please manually restart the intrusion detection
service.

Here are the full patch notes:

18.7.3 (September 18, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Long-term IPv6 efforts continue in the form of further 6RD feature comfort
and a few edge-case fixes in IPv6 interface selection.  Please note there
is a reboot necessary due to a security advisory amendment and errata patch.

Progress was made on the importer that blocked further efforts in ZFS
installation originally planned for 18.7.  You can now list available ZFS
pool and import from any of those if you so wish.  Props to Smart-Soft for
the contribution.

18.7.2 (September 06, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Lots of third party security updates, plugin updates and minor enhancements
in overall system reliability.

In other news the firewall alias API has been finished in the development
version.  If you use the development version you cannot go back to the
production version until the API has been released there as well, which is
probably 18.7.3 so not too far away.  We are happy about all reports of the
new alias pages and API usability.

We will soon begin the migration work for FreeBSD 11.2 for 19.1, but please
keep in mind that we will be issuing security advisories to 11.1 when they
arise even beyond the original end of life policy.

18.7 (July 31, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For 3 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

Another 6 months passed by ever so quickly!  The main goal for 18.7,
nicknamed "Happy Hippo", is stability so we have not yet begun to adopt
FreeBSD 11.2, but there are several of its Intel NIC driver updates
included to bridge the gap until 19.1 comes out.  The upgrade also
includes a tremendous amount of IPv6 improvements including 6RD support
as well as authentication and backup framework consolidation.  Please
also take note that QinQ is no longer included in this release.

These are the most prominent changes since version 18.1:

* improved WAN DHCPv6 and SLAAC connectivity and tracking
* functional IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6RD) support
* improved default route handling and gateway switching
* OpenVPN default setup improvements for IPv6 and RADIUS attribute support
* Dpinger gateway monitoring integration
* password policies for local authentication and coupled TOTP
* Monit core integration to eventually replace the legacy notifications
* OpenSSH access via group and shell selection instead of privilege
* pluggable backup framework with new Nextcloud option
* sytem tunables are now also used as loader tunables
* unrestricted VLAN usage for e.g. Xen
* QinQ interface removal
* firmware GUI speedup, improved error parsing and console reboot hint
* ZFS on root boot support (installer support is pending, but opnsense-bootstrap works)
* ZFS and MSDOS config import support
* ISC DHCP version moves from 4.3 to 4.4
* RRDtool version moves from 1.2 to 1.7
* rework rc.syshook facility to use drop-in directories instead of suffixes
* backports of FreeBSD 11.2 Intel NIC drivers
* stand-alone frontend UI development tools
* language updates for Czech, French, German, Portuguese (Brazil)
* UI header security and SSL cipher hardening
* extensive UI cleanups and menu consolidation
* new and rewritten plugins: os-cache, os-lcdproc-sdeclcd, os-net-snmp,
  os-nut, os-openconnect, os-relayd 2.0, os-shadowsocks, os-theme-cicada,
  os-theme-rebellion, os-theme-tukan, os-wol 2.0

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.

* firewall: remove alias types urltable_ports and url_ports
* firewall: revert only binding to first interface address due to ambiguity in IPv6 local-link setups
* dnsmasq: unconditionally listen on loopback device but avoid binding more than 127.0.0.1 in IPv4
* installer: properly accept cancel on guided install
* installer: removed unused mail log feature
* ipsec: remove validation to support for IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel and vice versa
* web proxy: more elaborate fix of IDNA encode with leading dots
* mvc: always use std_bootgrid_reload() for bootgrid reloads
* ui: sidebar menu support for optional themes (contributed by Team Rebellion)
* plugins: os-dyndns 1.8 fixes Eurodns support
* plugins: os-theme-rebellion 1.3 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
* plugins: os-relayd 2.2 (contributed by Frank Brendel)
* plugins: os-siproxd 1.3 (contributed by Michael Muenz)
* ports: dhcp6c v20180720 with fix for raw support (contributed by Team Rebellion)
* ports: php 7.1.20 `[2] <https://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.1.20>`__ 

Migration notes and minor incomatibilities to look out for:

* SSH access is now bound to the "wheel" group which is automatically
  added to "admins" group, which "root" is a member of.  "root" is the
  only user that has a default shell, namely opnsense-shell, which is the
  root console menu.
* SSH access can be set for an arbitrary group as well under System:
  Administration for non-members of "admins" group.  However, in both
  cases only SCP works due to a request in the forum to be more proactive
  regarding yielding of shell access rights.  If you want a user to gain
  true SSH access you need to change their shell from "nologin" to an
  installed shell in their respective settings.
* Web GUI HTTPS ciphers have been hardened.  To gain access please use a
  recent browser.
* The authentication fallback for the GUI/system has been removed in
  favour of selecting multiple authentication servers at once.  Reassign
  your fallback as a primary authentication method or now use more than
  two methods.
* It has been found that although WAN interfaces require gateways to
  function, they do not necessarily have to be assigned in single-WAN
  scenarios to avoid interfering with WAN reply behaviour.  The "none"
  selection was therefore changed to "auto-detect" to reflect this and
  now is the recommended setting unless multi-WAN is used.
* In preparation for the firewall alias API the per-item descriptions have
  been removed along with support for the deprecated types urltable_ports
  and url_ports.
* OpenVPN /31 tunnel network calculation changed to use the first and last
  address as network address and broadcast address do not exist.  If you
  are affected, adjust your clients or export their configuration again
  which includes the configuration fix.  Additionally, /32 tunnel networks
  are now prohibited.

18.7.r2 (July 19, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


So far so good.  Here is another batch of changes for the upcoming 18.7
release from assorted areas.  Also included is the latest Suricata 4.0.5.

We have bundled the firewall alias API progress under the hood, but
it looks like we will miss our initial 18.7 target.  Sorry about that.
Though it should be worth the wait.  :)

As always with our pre-releases, only OpenSSL is provided at this point,
but can be switched for LibreSSL as soon as the release is available.
This release candidate does update directly into the 18.7 stable track
and subsequent release candidates.  Please let us know about your experience!

18.7.r1 (July 11, 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For 3 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

Another 6 months passed by ever so quickly!  The main goal for 18.7 is
stability so we have not yet begun to adopt FreeBSD 11.2, but there are
several Intel NIC driver updates included to bridge the gap until 19.1
comes out.  The upgrade also includes a tremendous amount of IPv6
improvements and authentication framework consolidation.  Please also
take note that QinQ is no longer included in this release.

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.
