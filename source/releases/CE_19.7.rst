===========================================================================================
19.7  "Jazzy Jaguar" Series
===========================================================================================



For four and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

19.7, nicknamed "Jazzy Jaguar", embodies an iteration of what should be
considered enjoyable user experience for firewalls in general: improved
statistics and visibility of rules, reliable and consistent live logging
and alias utility improvements.  Apart from the usual upgrades of third
party software to up-to-date releases, OPNsense now also offers built-in
remote system logging through Syslog-ng, route-based IPsec, updated
translations with Spanish as a brand new and already fully translated
language and newer Netmap code with VirtIO, VLAN child and vmxnet support.

Last but not least we would like to thank m.a.x. it for their sponsorship
of the default gateway priority switching feature and their continued work
of writing and maintaining plenty of community plugins.  This time around,
Maltrail, Netdata and WireGuard VPN have been freshly added to the mix.

19.7.6 (November 01, 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


As we are experiencing the Suricata community first hand in Amsterdam
we though to release this version a bit earlier than planned.  Included
is the latest Suricata 5.0.0 release in the development version.  That
means later this November we will releasing version 5 to the production
version as we finish up tweaking the integration and maybe pick up 5.0.1
as it becomes available.

LDAP TLS connectivity is now integrated into the system trust store,
which ensures that all required root and intermediate certificates will
be seen by the connection setup when they have been added to the authorities
section.  The same is true for trusting self-signed certificates.  On top
of this, IPsec now supports public key authentication as contributed by
Pascal Mathis.

19.7 (July 17, 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For four and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

19.7, nicknamed "Jazzy Jaguar", embodies an iteration of what should be
considered enjoyable user experience for firewalls in general: improved
statistics and visibility of rules, reliable and consistent live logging
and alias utility improvements.  Apart from the usual upgrades of third
party software to up-to-date releases, OPNsense now also offers built-in
remote system logging through Syslog-ng, route-based IPsec, updated
translations with Spanish as a brand new and already fully translated
language and newer Netmap code with VirtIO, VLAN child and vmxnet support.

Last but not least we would like to thank m.a.x. it for their sponsorship
of the default gateway priority switching feature and their continued work
of writing and maintaining plenty of community plugins.  This time around,
Maltrail, Netdata and WireGuard VPN have been freshly added to the mix.

Download links, an installation guide `[1] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html>`__  and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.

* Europe: https://opnsense.c0urier.net/releases/19.7/

* South-East Asia: https://ftp.yzu.edu.tw/opnsense/releases/19.7/
* Full mirror list: https://opnsense.org/download/

These are the most prominent changes since version 19.1:

* List automatic firewall rules
* Statistics for all firewall rules
* Alias JSON import / export
* Optional statistics for aliases
* Firewall rule locator for live log and automatic rules
* Rewritten gateway handling and switching
* Remote logging via Syslog-ng
* LDAP group sync support
* Support certificate signing requests
* Route-based IPsec support (VTI)
* XMLRPC sync support for alias, VHID, widgets
* Unbound host overrides alias support
* Web proxy and IPsec authentication using PAM
* Parent web proxy support
* Web proxy login privilege via group
* Improved reliability and utility of opnsense-patch
* Dpinger and DHCP servers ported to plugin framework
* Language updates for Chinese, Czech, Japanese, German, French, Russian and Portuguese

* Netmap update for VirtIO, VLAN child and vmxnet support
* Bootstrap 3.4, LibreSSL 2.9, Unbound 1.9, PHP 7.2, Python 3.7, Squid 4

* ports: rrdtool 1.7.2 `[7] <https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/releases/tag/v1.7.2>`__ 

Known issues and limitations:

* Web proxy squid update from version 3 to 4 breaks the cache database.  To repair go to "Services: Web Proxy: Administration" tab "Support" and click "Reset".
* Web proxy login privilege is no longer available.  Access may be restricted by a group selector instead.
* Nano images require a reinstall using the latest image to avoid inode shortage which makes the system appear to run out of space during recent 19.1.x updates.
* OpenVPN no longer supports listening on gateway groups.  Use localhost paired with port forwards instead.
