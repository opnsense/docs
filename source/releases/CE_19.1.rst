19.1  "Inspiring Iguana" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than four years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and
reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD security,
fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable
2-Clause BSD licensing.

The 19.1 release, nicknamed "Inspiring Iguana", consists of a total of
620 individual changes since 18.7 came out 6 months ago, spread out over
12 intermediate releases including the recent release candidates.  That is
the average of 2 stable releases per month, security updates and important
bug fixes included!  If we had to pick a few highlights it would be: The
firewall alias API is finally in place.  The migration to HardenedBSD 11.2
has been completed.  2FA now works with a remote LDAP / local TOTP
combination.  And the OpenVPN client export was rewritten for full API
support as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.1.7 (May 02, 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update features a number of improvements such as link-local support
for bridges, HA sync consolidation, adding local CAs to the trusted SSL
certificates for most of the system download capabilities, plugin-based
PAM authentication rework for IPsec and the web proxy as well as third
party fixes for hostapd / wpa_supplicant 2.8 and Suricata 4.1.4.

Python 3 migration is also underway now which requires to pull in both
Python versions which may be heavy on embedded Nano installs, but we
cannot see another way for this tedious task which will probably stretch
into 19.7 to be fully carried out in 20.1.

And speaking of 20.1: This is the first of many reminders that 20.1 will
discontinue the i386 (Intel 32 Bit) franchise as discussed a number of
times within the community over the years.  Our hope is that ARM64 will
make a viable replacement.  But that is for another time.

As you may have noticed the project has not been delivering releases every
other week and there are a number of reasons for it:

Security-wise we have not had a lot of necessary third-party software
updates.  Feature-wise we are sitting on a number of improvements for the
upcoming 19.7 series that will trickle into 19.1.x now, but that have also
required larger preparations and testing in the meantime.  On the community
side of the spectrum, sponsored by our partner m.a.x. it, we have started
to work on better default gateway switching which led to an overall gateway
integration rework and then quickly to interface handling restructuring,
which in turn led to improving plugin capabilities of core services
(OpenVPN, IPsec, Unbound, Dnsmasq, DHCPD, Dpinger).  Looking at it now it
has been the largest rework so far on code established many years ago and
only occasionally patched.  We hope this shows our dedication to the code
base even when things are not always 100% bug free.  If you feel like
pitching in now is a good time to try the development version and let us
know about how it performs.

Without further ado, here are the full patch notes:

* system: HA sync cleanup removes opportunistic syncs in random GUI pages (use HA status page to sync and restart remote services)
* system: support for syncing alias and VHID to the slave

19.1.6 (April 11, 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update brings a smaller number of fixes and improvements as well as
the latest PHP version update.

With a heavy heart we disable E_WARNING messages in the PHP error reporting.
It has been implemented in 2015 to improve code quality and it did just that,
but with the latest PHP 7.2 jump in 19.1.5 it causes problems around the
newly added count() usage warning messages.  We plan to bring back E_WARNING
usage in 19.7.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: let dashboard only accept its own POST requests
* system: remove obsolete symlink to opnsense-auth
* system: skip PHP E_WARNING log level until 19.7
* system: numerous PHP 7.2 warning fixes
* dhcp: DHCPD server check in relay only if interface is active
* dnsmasq: skip empty custom options
* intrusion prevention: do not drop flowbits:noalert rules
* unbound: add ACL entries for OpenVPN by default
* mvc: controller cleanups in firewall shaper, web proxy and captive portal
* plugins: numerous PHP 7.2 warning fixes
* plugins: os-freeradius 1.9.2 fixes LDAP group filter and EAP certificates write (contributed by Alexander Harm)

19.1.4 (March 12, 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


An UEFI boot panic scenario was debugged last week with the help of the
community.  This update includes a fix that will allow the ones affected
by this 19.1 issue to upgrade or install (and boot of course) correctly.
We are also including the IPsec VTI support and the latest Suricata 4.1.3
with stability and compatibility fixes.

Due to the severity of the UEFI boot panic 19.1.4 will be the new initial
release for all upgrades from 18.7 within a day or two depending on
additional testing and confirmation.  Last but not least there will be
new images some time next week to put this fully behind us.  Thank you
for your patience and understanding.  :)

Special thanks go to the team of Synacktiv for reporting a packet filter
IPv6 vulnerability for which a patch was included as well.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: remove erroneously translated hostname example (contributed by nhirokinet)
* firewall: fix validation regression in outbound NAT introduced in 19.1.3
* firewall: mock labels for NAT rules in live log as pf does not offer label support
* interfaces: do not background LAGG ifconfig destroy
* installer: revert to use network connection to allow CTRL+C and resume
* ipsec: added Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI) support

19.1.3 (March 07, 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a smaller stable update consisting of LDAPS authentication
server improvements, Unbound host overrides alias support, OpenSSL
1.0.2r security update and the recent PAM rework for better privilege
separation.

We are currently focusing on IPsec VTI, third-party service PAM
integration and investigating kernel boot crashes.  In the latter
case we are aware of the update issues some people are having and
recommend running 18.7 until this is taken care of.  Above all,
please be patient.  New images and seamless upgrade paths will be
provided as soon as the problems have been pinned down.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: improve LDAPS mode and related authentication cleanups
* system: move enable checkbox to the top in remote logging settings
* system: allow reset of tunables to to factory defaults
* system: new tunables factory default to prevent ICMP redirects being sent (net.inet.icmp.drop_redirect=1)
* firewall: allow explicitly setting source hash key in outbound NAT (Fredrik Ronnvall)
* interfaces: probe media before applying new settings
* interfaces: correctly compare MAC addresses
* dhcp: added TFTP bootfile-name (contributed by Bjorn Kalkbrenner)
* firmware: move duty to return the correct set name / ID to opnsense-version
* firmware: finally revoke 18.7 fingerprint
* intrusion detection: minor template cleanups using helpers.empty()
* ipsec: peer identifier can now fall back to remote-gateway in manual SPD entries
* ipsec: allow easier override of colours in widget (contributed by Fabian Franz)
* monit: add validation for test type (contributed by Frank Brendel)
* openvpn: add auth-nocache option in exporter
* openvpn: validate certificate type for servers
* unbound: add host overrides alias support

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.1.2 (February 28, 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This update is the sum of a few weeks of intense testing and debugging
in areas such as WAN DHCP with very short lease times, Suricata IPS not
working as expected, stacked 6RD setups that have overly long device names
amongst others.

The update may be a bit bumpy this time since the web GUI session directory
will be moved to a safer location.  You will be logged out during the update
and the system will reboot due to the included operating system update.  As
soon as it is back you will be able to log in as usual.

LibreSSL received a major upgrade from 2.7 to 2.8. If you are using LibreSSL
and see any issues please do let us know because it sadly looks like third
party projects such as OpenVPN, Squid, StrongSwan and NTP leave the use of
LibreSSL to the few users who are able to fix the source code builds on their
own and we want to ideally avoid having to patch third party software.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: move session files into their own directory (forces the current sessions to expire)
* system: add validation check for time period for Dpinger (contributed by Team Rebellion)
* system: hide "show certificate info" button of pending CSR (contributed by nhirokinet)
* system: move opnsense-auth to libexec, but keep a symlink in sbin directory

* system: fix ACL for halt and reboot pages
* firewall: fix alias entry replacement in utility page
* firewall: prevent new alias creation when adding an address
* firewall: capture "nat" traffic like we do for "rdr" in live log
* firewall: escaping issues in schedule edit page
* interfaces: push dhclient and dhcp6c log messages to system log
* interfaces: write all nameservers via dhclient-script in multi WAN scenarios
* interfaces: check for valid alias IP in dhclient-script
* interfaces: 6RD interface naming back to 18.7 to sidestep character limits on stacked setups
* interfaces: avoid reading empty interface configurations
* firmware: bootstrap rework for HTTPS repository URL
* firmware: patch cache and assorted improvements
* firmware: minor update utility cleanups
* firmware: remove compatibility stubs for pre-19.1 version reads

19.1 (January 31, 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more than four years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and
reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD security,
fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable
2-Clause BSD licensing.

The 19.1 release, nicknamed "Inspiring Iguana", consists of a total of
620 individual changes since 18.7 came out 6 months ago, spread out over
12 intermediate releases including the recent release candidates.  That is
the average of 2 stable releases per month, security updates and important
bug fixes included!  If we had to pick a few highlights it would be: The
firewall alias API is finally in place.  The migration to HardenedBSD 11.2
has been completed.  2FA now works with a remote LDAP / local TOTP
combination.  And the OpenVPN client export was rewritten for full API
support as well.

Download links, an installation guide `[1] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html>`__  and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.

* Europe: https://opnsense.c0urier.net/releases/19.1/

* extended IPv6 DUID support
* Dnsmasq DNSSEC support
* OpenVPN client export API
* Realtek NIC driver version 1.95
* HardenedBSD 11.2, LibreSSL 2.7
* Unbound 1.8, Suricata 4.1
* Phalcon 3.4, Perl 5.28
* firmware health check extended to cover all OS files, HTTPS mirror default
* updates are browser cache-safe regarding CSS and JavaScript assets
* collapsible side bar menu in the default theme
* language updates for Chinese, Czech, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese and Russian
* new plugins for API backup export, Bind, Hardware widget, Nginx, Ntopng, VnStat, Dnscrypt-proxy

Here are the full changes against version 19.1-RC2:

* ipsec: add firewall interface as soon as phase 1 is enabled
* ipsec: phase 1 selection GUI JavaScript compatibility fix
* monit: widget improvements and bug fix (contributed by Frank Brendel)
* ui: fix regression in single host or network subnet select in static pages

* plugins: os-theme-rebellion 1.8.2 adds image colour invert
* plugins: os-vnstat 1.1 `[3] <https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/master/net/vnstat/pkg-descr>`__ 
* plugins: os-zabbix-agent now uses Zabbix version 4.0
* src: revert mmc_calculate_clock() as HS200/HS400 support breaks legacy support
* src: update sqlite3-3.20.0 to sqlite3-3.26.0 `[4] <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-19:03.sqlite.asc>`__ 
* src: import tzdata 2018h, 2018i `[5] <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-19:04.tzdata.asc>`__

* ports: sudo patch to fix listpw=never `[7] <https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=869>`__ 

Migration notes and minor incompatibilities to look out for:

* Gateway health graphs may need a manual reset due to the Apinger to Dpinger migration.  Apinger is no longer available.
* Intrusion detection GeoIP rules are automatically deactivated and need to be manually migrated to firewall alias GeoIP.
* Quagga plugin has been superseded by FRR plugin.  A binary quagga package has been conserved for the time being.
* Please read the FRR documentation with regard to the required system tunables `[8] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/dynamic_routing.html>`__ .
* Bhyve VM boot may fail as a guest.  Use the "-w" parameter `[9] <https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=11492.0>`__  to boot.
* Boot may fail due to Meltdown/Spectre mitigation.  A workaround `[10] <https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues/3177>`__  exists.
* SNMP plugin has been superseded by Net-SNMP plugin.
