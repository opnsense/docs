After opening the box of your just delivered appliance, there should be a quickstart included.

the following series:

------------------------------------
Port assignments
------------------------------------

The Ethernet ports of the appliance are assigned as follows:

Port **0** is assigned to LAN with IP address :code:`192.168.1.1` and has a DHCP Server running with IP range
from :code:`192.168.1.100` to :code:`192.168.1.199`.

Port **1** is assigned to WAN and uses DHCP Client to obtain an IP-address.

Additional ports available on the device are left unconfigured, you can  assign them later using :menuselection:`Interfaces->Assignments`.

.. Note::

      Ports on the devices are all numbered, 0-**X** (e.g. 0,1,2) for all 1 gbps standard ethernet ports,
      X0-X\ **X** for SFP+ ports (e.g. X0, X1), XXV0-XXV\ **X** for SFP28 ports (e.g. XXV0, XXV1).
      The numbering corresponds with the driver numbering, e.g. port **0** is usually :code:`igb0`, see the product
      range for drivers used in the different models
