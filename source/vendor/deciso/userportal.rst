User Portal
======================================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

Preparation
---------------------------

In order to effectively use this module, make sure to allow users to login to OPNsense using a username and password
when they are on the local network.


General
---------------------------

.. image:: images/user_portal.png
    :width: 50%

The portal replaces the simple user password menu, which can be found at :menuselection:`Lobby --> Password` and
offers additional functionality for self-service support.

Depending on the configuration users are able to change their password and language here, download and re-generate one time
password tokens and access OpenVPN profiles for the instances they have access to.


.. Note::

    The visible tabs depend on access rights configured in the administration part.


Administration
---------------------------

Under :menuselection:`System --> Settings --> Portal Admin` you will find the administration part of the portal, this
includes generic account settings and OpenVPN instance access.


Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here you will find the basic settings for the portal

================================ ========================================================================================
Option                           Description
================================ ========================================================================================
Allow OTP token creation         Select which group a user should be a member of to manage it's own token
User portal welcome message      Welcome message (first tab content), may include html formatted text.
================================ ========================================================================================


OpenVPN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenVPN tab shows a grid where you can add instances which a user should have access to, it contains most of the
settings also available in the standard OpenVPN export module.


================================ ========================================================================================
Option                           Description
================================ ========================================================================================
Member of                        Select which group a user should be a member of to download a profile
Server instance                  The instance we grant access to
Certificate lifetime (days)      Lifetime of a certificate, after expiry the user can not login anymore
Certificate Key type             Type of certificate to include in the profile
Certificate Digest Algorithm     Digest algoritm used to generate the certificate
Export template                  Type of file the user will download
Hostname                         The hostname or ip address used to contact this firewall
Description                      Description shown to the user for this instance download
================================ ========================================================================================


.. Tip::

    If a user should be allowed to download multiple file formats for the same service, you can duplicate
    the entry. Simply use different descriptions per entry.


Configuration example
---------------------------------

The following configuration outlines a pretty common business case with the following requirements:

Users should get:

    - an OpenVPN profile with user certificate
    - Two-Factor authentication with TOTP
    - access to a self-service portal to manage their password, OTP token and OpenVPN profile


1. Configure default groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will create three groups that control access to the user portal, OTP token and OpenVPN profile.

Go to :menuselection:`System --> Access --> Groups` and add the following groups:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: user_default_priv

        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Option**                                **Description**
        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Group name**                            ``user_default_priv``
        **Privileges**                            ``Lobby: Password``
        ========================================= ====================================================================================

        - Press **Save** and add next

        .. Note::

            This allows members to access the user portal and manage their passwords.

    .. tab:: user_otp_priv

        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Option**                                **Description**
        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Group name**                            ``user_otp_priv``
        ========================================= ====================================================================================

        - Press **Save** and add next

        .. Note::

            This group does not need any privileges, we will use it for the user portal configuration in a later step to allow
            members access to the OTP tokens.

    .. tab:: user_ovpn_priv

        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Option**                                **Description**
        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Group name**                            ``user_ovpn_priv``
        ========================================= ====================================================================================

        - Press **Save** and add next

        .. Note::

            This group does not need any privileges, we will use it for the user portal configuration in a later step to allow
            members access to the OpenVPN instance.

        .. Tip::

            You can create multiple groups here, e.g., ``user_ovpn_priv_sales``, ``user_ovpn_priv_admin`` so you can control access
            to multiple OpenVPN instances.

2. Configure a user (Onboarding)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we need a user that will become a member of the groups we created.

Go to :menuselection:`System --> Access --> User` and add the following user:

========================================= ====================================================================================
**Option**                                **Description**
========================================= ====================================================================================
**Username**                              ``john``
**Password**                              Set a password
**Group Membership**                      ``user_default_priv, user_otp_priv, user_ovpn_priv``
========================================= ====================================================================================

- Press **Save**

.. Note::

    Creating a user certificate is not necessary, the user portal will automagically create one for the user when they download
    an OpenVPN configuration. Same goes for the OTP token which the user can create themselves.

.. Tip::

    When using an LDAP authentication server, creating users manually is not needed. Go to :menuselection:`System --> Access --> Servers`
    and enable `Automatic user creation`. For `Default groups`, choose ``user_default_priv``. Add the groups
    ``user_otp_priv`` and ``user_ovpn_priv`` to users on the LDAP server. Please note that all groups must be created manually and share
    the same name between :menuselection:`System --> Access --> Groups` and the LDAP server.

3. Configure Authentication Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We require two server types:

    - The default server ``Local Database`` will allow users to authenticate with the user portal.
    - The additional server ``Local Database + TOTP`` will be used for OpenVPN.

Go to :menuselection:`System --> Access --> Servers` and add the following additional server:

========================================= ====================================================================================
**Option**                                **Description**
========================================= ====================================================================================
**Descriptive name**                      ``Local Database + TOTP``
**Type**                                  ``Local + Timebased One Time Password``
========================================= ====================================================================================

- Press **Save**

.. Attention::

    If you set the authentication server in :menuselection:`System --> Settings --> Administration` to the
    ``Local Database + TOTP`` option, users cannot manage their own OTP tokens in the user portal without prior
    help from an administrator; because they need an OTP token for authentication and might not have one yet.
    Especially if you choose an LDAP variant and have a big userbase, take this into consideration if everything
    should be fully automated. This is why we suggest using two authentication server types so users will be able
    to authenticate to the user portal without using TOTP.

4. Configure OpenVPN Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to :menuselection:`VPN --> OpenVPN --> Instances` and add a new instance.

You can use the following section as guidance: :doc:`/manual/how-tos/sslvpn_instance_roadwarrior`

Here are the adjustments to make in the instance configuration when following that guide:

========================================= ====================================================================================
**Option**                                **Description**
========================================= ====================================================================================
**Description**                           ``user_ovpn_priv``
**Authentication**                        ``Local Database + TOTP``
========================================= ====================================================================================

.. Note::

    Setting the description of the instance as the prior created group name
    makes administration in the user portal simpler.

5. Configure User Portal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to :menuselection:`System --> Settings --> Portal Admin` and set the following options:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Settings

        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Option**                                **Description**
        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Allow OTP token creation**              ``user_otp_priv``
        ========================================= ====================================================================================

        - Press **Apply** and go to next tab

        .. Note::

            This allows any user in the ``user_otp_priv`` group to access the OTP self-service in the user portal.


    .. tab:: OpenVPN

        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Option**                                **Description**
        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Member of**                             ``user_ovpn_priv``
        **Server instance**                       ``[Server] user_ovpn_priv``
        **Export template**                       ``Archive``
        **Static Challenge**                      ``X``
        **Hostname**                              The FQDN of your firewall with A-Record in the public DNS
        **Description**                           ``user_ovpn_priv_archive``
        ========================================= ====================================================================================

        Press **Save** and add another choice if you want to offer e.g., Viscosity as alternative download option

        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Option**                                **Description**
        ========================================= ====================================================================================
        **Member of**                             ``user_ovpn_priv``
        **Server instance**                       ``[Server] user_ovpn_priv``
        **Export template**                       ``Viscosity (visc)``
        **Static Challenge**                      ``X``
        **Hostname**                              The FQDN of your firewall with A-Record in the public DNS
        **Description**                           ``user_ovpn_priv_viscosity``
        ========================================= ====================================================================================

        - Press **Save** and **Apply**

        .. Tip::

            Enabling `Static Challenge` will create a pop up that asks for the OTP token so that users do not have to merge it with
            their user password manually.

        .. Note::

            You can create multiple instances and choose which group can download which configuration.

        .. Attention::

            Keep the `Certificate lifetime` in mind. The user cannot renew their own certificate, an administrator must do it for them.
            Alternatively, choose a very high lifetime here that is in the range of the CA you created before. E.g., if the CA is valid for
            10 years, you can set the certificate lifetime to 5 years. The long lifetime should be fine if you deploy additional
            user authentication with one time password as outlined in this guide.


6. Test User Portal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that the initial configuration is complete, test the user portal.

Check in :menuselection:`System --> Settings --> Administration` that the ``Listen Interfaces`` are either on any, or include the interface
your users will use for accessing the user portal. Do not forget to create a firewall rule that allows access to the WebGUI from this network.

.. Attention::

    It is not adviced to allow access to the WebGUI from public networks without restriction.

If you are corrently logged into the WebGUI admin, open a different browser or an incognito tab. Open the same URL you would use to log in
as administrator, but instead log in with the user you created earlier (john).

You will now see the user portal as landing page. Here, the configurations you created in the prior steps will show their results.

The user will be able to change their password, generate their own OTP token, and download the OpenVPN configuration files; which also
automagically generates their user certificate.

.. Tip::

    Additional users can be created by repeating the onboarding step.

7. Remove Access (Offboarding)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The prior steps outlined most of the onboarding process. Though, what should happen if the user access must be removed?

Go to :menuselection:`System --> Access --> User` and remove all ``Group memberships`` and ``Privileges``, regenerate the ``OTP
seed`` and set the ``Disabled`` flag. After saving, the users rights will be nullified, and even if it will be re-enabled, the
user will not be able to elevate their rights as they cannot log into the user portal, or use their OTP token to establish an OpenVPN connection.

.. Attention::

    If you use an LDAP authentication server, you must deactivate the user on that server. Keep the group memberships in mind, also
    the current default groups you might have set.

As further step, invalidate the user certificate.

Go to :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Revocation` and edit the CA you created for the OpenVPN instance. If there is no CRL yet, create one by
setting a `Description` and pressing **Apply**.

Afterwards, edit the CA again, and select a ``Revocation per type``, e.g., ``Unspecified`` where you choose the created user certificate. After applying,
this certificate will no longer be valid.

.. Attention::

    Deleting a certificate from the GUI will not invalidate it. You must use the revocation component to publish the revocation to the OpenVPN instance.
