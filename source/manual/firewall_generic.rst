Generic info

This chapter explains some of the concepts that are used in different modules of our firewall system and
therefore don't belong to a specific section of this topic.

Address types
-----------------------------------------

When choosing source and/or destination addresses, the user can choose several options depending on the context.
To explain what the different options mean when being presented, we will summarize them below:

========================================================================================================================================================

====================================  ==================================================================================================================
Alias                                 Flexible type of network or address definition for easy reuse, expained in
                                      :doc:`aliases </manual/aliases>`
Single host or network                Standard host or network in `CIDR notation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing>`__
any                                   All IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses (in the world)

[Interface] Network                   All networks assigned to the device, this will also include networks of assigned virtual addresses
                                      ([Interface] is explained in the :doc:`interfaces </manual/interfaces>` topic). Normally used to allow traffic
                                      from or to clients connected to a specific interface.
[Interface] Address                   All addresses configured on an interface, this includes all virtual (alias) addresses as well.
