OPNsense fully supports IPv6 for routing and firewall. However there are lots of
different options to utilize IPv6. Currently these scenarios are known to work:

* Native IPv6 only
* Dual Stack IPv4 + IPv6
* IPv6 <-> IP4v Tunnel broker

.. Warning::

  NAT64, IPv4 <-> IPv6 Network address translations, is currently not supported
  by HardenedBSD.
