==================
Trust
==================

In OPNsense, certificates are used for ensuring trust between peers. To make using them easier, OPNsense allows creating
certificates from the front-end. In addition to that, it also allows creating certificates for other purposes,
avoiding the need to use the ``openssl`` command line tool. Certificates in OPNsense can be managed from
:menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Certificates`.

Examples of OPNsense components that use certificates:

* OpenVPN
* IPsec
* Captive Portal
* Web Proxy

---------------------
Certificate types
---------------------

The following types of certificate can be generated in OPNsense:

* Client
* Server
* Combined Client/Server
* Certificate Authority

In addition to this, OPNsense can generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). This can be used if you want to create a
certficate signed by an external CA.

.. warning::

    Make sure that you select the correct certificate type, as many clients will refuse connection (or at least show
    errors) if an incorrect certificate type is used. For example, you can use either a server certificate or a
    combined client/server certificate to secure the connection to the web interface, but not a CA or client certificate.


---------------------
Settings
---------------------

In :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Settings` you can find some advanced options to manage how the system handles trust.
For compliance reasons, it is possible to implement certain constraints when a default OpenSSL context is requested.

===================================== =======================================================================================================================
 **Options**                           **Description**
===================================== =======================================================================================================================
Store intermediate                    Allow local defined intermediate certificate authorities to be used in the local trust store.
                                      We advise to only store root certificates to prevent cross signed ones causing breakage when included
                                      but expired later in the chain.
Store CRL's                           Store all configured CRL's in the default trust store. If the client or service support CRL's,
                                      deploying to the default location eases maintenance.
Auto fetch CRL's                      Schedule an hourly job to download CRLs using the defined Distributionpoints in the CAs deployed in our trust store.
Enable legacy                         Enable Legacy Providers. (Enables ciphers which will be removed in future versions of OpenSSL)
Configuration constraints             When enabled, you can set some default ciphers and protocols, be careful with these options
                                      as these settings will be used by wuite some applications of the firewall (and might break them).
===================================== =======================================================================================================================

.. Note::
    Applications are not forced to use a standard context, depending the application, custom constraints may
    or may not have any effect.

---------------------
Revoke certificates
---------------------

............................................
Certificate Revocation Lists
............................................

A Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) is a list of certificates that have been revoked by the certificate authority.
Some services in OPNsense can use these to validate if a certificate is still valid to use even though it might not
be expired.

Defining a CRL in OPNsense is not very complicated, just go to :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Revocation`
and click on the [+] sign for your (local) certficate authority to create a new CRL. When a CRL exists, you may
edit it and add or remove certificates in it (using the pencil icon).

.. Note::

    .. raw:: html

        If you wish to use a CRL for external tools you can download it using the  <i class="fa fa-download fa-fw"></i>  button


One of the downsides of a CRL is that they don't scale very well, each consumer of the list should download the full list in
order to know if a certificate can still be trusted. Information often is less accurate as these lists usually
are only generated on certain intervals.

When using a CRL for a local authority on OPNsense itself the scaling part usually isn't a large issue as
the number of certificates is usually limited (for example to the number of employees in your organisation).

To manually verify the created certificates using :code:`openssl` commands, you need the following ingredients:

1.  The CA certificate chain which signed the certificates (export "cert" from Authorities menu)
2.  The CRL created in OPNsense (export "crl" from Revocation menu)
3.  A revoked certificate (export "cert" from Certificates menu)
4.  A non expired or revoked certificate

First we concatenate both the CA chain and the CRL into a single "chain" file:

::

    # cat ca_chain.crt ca_crl.crl > my_chain.pem

Then validate a revoked certificate using the following :code:`openssl` command:

::

    # openssl verify -crl_check -CAfile my_chain.pem revoked_cert.crt
    C=NL, CN=my_cert
    error 23 at 0 depth lookup: certificate revoked
    error ocsp_user_cert2.crt: verification failed

And a valid certificate:

::

    # openssl verify -crl_check -CAfile my_chain.pem ok_cert.crt
    ocsp_server_cert.crt: OK



............................................
Online Certificate Status Protocol
............................................

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (`OCSP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol>`__) offers similar functionality as the CRL's described earlier, but validates
certificates "online" and offers a whitelising instead of a blacklisting method.
Certificates are checked against an online known set of certificates after which the server responds with
'good', 'revoked', or 'unknown'. Only good responses are considered valid.

In order to explain the client verifying a certificate where to check it's validity, the :code:`AuthorityInfoAccess` extenstion
should be provided in the certificate authority (The parameter :code:`OCSP uri` adds this to the certificate in OPNsense).

.. Tip::

    .. raw:: html

        You can use the  <i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-fw"></i>  button to find the ocsp uri when available.


The OCSP responder (server) which validates the 'OCSP request' needs a special signing certificate, which can
be created in OPNsense via :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Authorities`, issued by the same CA which created the
user and/or server certificates.

OPNsense does not implement an OCSP responder, but to test the concept, we can use the
`openssl-ocsp <https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man1/openssl-ocsp.html>`__ command.

.. Note::

    openssl-ocsp is only intended to be used for test and demonstration purposes.

In order to test the concept, we need the following ingredients:

1.  The CA certificate chain which signed the certificates (export "cert" from Authorities menu)
2.  The OCSP signer certificate (export "cert" and "key" from Authorities menu for the signer)
3.  An index file for openssl-ocsp (export index from Revocation menu) as specified in https://pki-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cadb.html
4.  A serial number of a revoked certificate (use the info button to find the serial number)
5.  A serial number of a non expired or revoked certificate

First start the server in a console:

::

    # openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8081 -rsigner ocsp_signer.crt -rkey ocsp_signer.key -CA ca.crt -ignore_err -text

Then verify a known good certificate (with serial number 1):

::

    # openssl ocsp -url http://127.0.0.1:8081 -CAfile ca.crt -issuer ca.crt -serial 1
    Response verify OK
    1: good
	    This Update: Jan  6 13:33:59 2024 GMT


A revoked one:

::

    # openssl ocsp -url http://127.0.0.1:8081 -CAfile ca.crt -issuer ca.crt -serial 2
    Response verify OK
    2: revoked
        This Update: Jan  6 13:34:54 2024 GMT
        Revocation Time: Jan 1 21:31:08 2024 GMT


And an unknown certificate

::

    # openssl ocsp -url http://127.0.0.1:8081 -CAfile ca.crt -issuer ca.crt -serial 9999
    Response verify OK
    9999: unknown
        This Update: Jan  6 13:36:51 2024 GMT


-------------------------
Internal organisation
-------------------------

In this paragraph we would like to explain the organisation of the internal trust store.
The certificates and revocation lists that exist are staged into system directories and deployed for usage by
a tool called :code:`certctl.py` on our end.

The source for certificates and revocation lists is collected in the following directories, either shipped with the base system
and/or managed from OPNsense:

===================================== =======================================================================================================================
**Path**                              **Topic**
===================================== =======================================================================================================================
/usr/share/certs/trusted              Default system certificates, shipped with the base system
/usr/local/share/certs                Application specific certificates and revocation lists
/usr/share/certs/untrusted            Certificates that are not to be trusted anymore
===================================== =======================================================================================================================

:code:`certctl.py` collects all certificates from the set defined above and creates links to them in the target directories specified
below.

===================================== =======================================================================================================================
**Path**                              **Topic**
===================================== =======================================================================================================================
/etc/ssl/certs                        Directory with links (and files) to certificates named by their hash.
                                      (for example :code:`ef954a4e.0` or :code:`ef954a4e.r0` for a CRL)
                                      Primary location for the base system.
/etc/ssl/untrusted                    Same as above, but untrusted (ignored)
/usr/local/openssl/certs              Same as :code:`/etc/ssl/certs`, default location for applications build from the "ports" tree
/usr/local/etc/ssl/cert.pem           Combined bundle file for applications that require a single file.
===================================== =======================================================================================================================

Each target link (or file) contains a single certificate or revocation list, which OpenSSL can easily locate using the
certificate subject.

.. Note::
    If either :code:`/etc/ssl/cert.pem`  and/or :code:`/usr/local/etc/ssl/cert.pem` exists, they will have preference above
    the hashed links insode the target directories. Staring with OPNsense version 25.1, these files will be removed
    when they exist.


Default settings for OpenSSL are saved into :code:`/usr/local/openssl/openssl.cnf` (ports) and :code:`/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`
(base), both are managed by OPNsense.


-------------------------
Usage examples
-------------------------
In :doc:`/manual/how-tos/self-signed-chain` you will find examples of how to setup certificate chains yourself.
