Quick Overview
--------------
*Boot Environments* are *Snapshots* that capture the base system at a given moment. They're useful for administration, as they introduce a fallback boot option when more risky operations like major upgrades or experimental configurations fail. If something goes wrong, it is quite simple to roll back to the previous working state.

These *Snapshots* leverage ZFS features, making them space-efficient and easy to manage. During the boot process, the latest and previous saved *Snapshots* can be chosen with *Option 8*, effectively switching between different system states.

.. Note:: **Boot Environments require ZFS as filesystem**. UFS will not work since it does not support file system level snapshots.

The *Snapshots* are differential. A new *Snapshot* is always the latest current running state. This means, there are no incremental *Snapshot* chains, as seen in other implementations such as Hypervisors.

.. Note:: Each Snapshot can be created and deleted as its own self contained entity with no other dependencies. For practical reasons, it is not recommended to keep more than two *Snapshots*.

--------------------
Recommended Workflow
--------------------

#. Create a new Snapshot
#. Activate the new Snapshot
#. Do administrative changes (e.g. firmware upgrade)
#. Reboot and test the changes:

* OPNsense works as expected: 
    * Remove the old *default* Snapshot
    * Rename the current active Snapshot to *default*
* OPNsense has issues: 
    * Select the old *default* Snapshot in the Boot Menu
    * After booting, delete the known faulty Snapshot

.. Tip:: This workflow ensures that the *default* Snapshot is always the *last known good state*.

Tutorial

As an example, there is a major upgrade to a new OPNsense version. To have the option of a quick rollback when things do not turn out as expected, creating a *Snapshot* before doing the changes is the best choice.

.. Note:: This is useful for *Hardware Appliances*. A virtualized OPNsense will have other recovery options that leverage the features of the Hypervisor itself, like creating VM level snapshots.

.. _snapshot-creating:


*******************
Creating a Snapshot
*******************

* | Go to :menuselection:`System --> Snapshots`
* | Select **+** to create a new *Snapshot*, use the default name
* | Activate the new *Snapshot* by clicking **âœ“** next to it
* | At this point, the OPNsense writes all changes to the new Snapshot, marked as **Active R**

.. Tip:: Now, there should be one Snapshot named *default* which is *Active N*, and a new Snapshot with a timestamp that is *Active R*.

At this point, upgrade the OPNsense to a new version. These changes will all happen in the new active Snapshot, leaving the *default* Snapshot as *last known good state*.


******************
Booting a Snapshot
******************

If the upgrade introduced some issues, the *default Snapshot* can be booted from the *OPNsense Boot Menu*.

.. Note:: If the Hardware Appliance does not have *VGA*, using *Serial* is the best choice to expose the *Boot Menu*.

* | Boot the OPNsense, at the start of the boot sequence the *Boot Menu* will show up
* | Press the *Space Bar* to pause it
* | Press ``8`` to choose ``8. Boot Environments`` which displays the current *Snapshots*
* | Press ``2`` to select a different *active Snapshot*, it should now display ``zfs:zroot/ROOT/default``
* | Press ``1`` to go back to the *main menu*
* | Press ``ENTER`` to select ``1. Boot Multi user [ENTER]``

.. Tip:: If there are more Snapshots, press ``2`` repeatedly to cycle through them.


*******************
Deleting a Snapshot
*******************

Now that the OPNsense has booted to its *last known good state* with the *default Snapshot*, it is time to clean up the *faulty Snapshot*.

* | Go to :menuselection:`System --> Snapshots`
* | Check that the *default Snapshot* is *Active R*
* | Press **ðŸ—‘** next to the Snapshot that is currently *Active N* - most likely the one with a timestamp as name
* | At this point, the OPNsense is correctly configured back to the old *default* Snapshot state, marked as **Active NR**

.. Note:: :ref:`Creating a Snapshot <snapshot-creating>` can be repeated to retry the major upgrade. For other scenarios, refer to the :ref:`Recommended Workflow <snapshot-recommended-workflow>` for a quick overview.
