===================
Reporting Settings
===================

Some basic reporting settings and options can be found under :menuselection:`Reporting --> Settings`.

The Health reporting uses RRD collection, for which you can disable the statistics collection process, in cases where monitoring is not
relevant or causes too much stress on the system. The option to collect statistics is enabled by default.

For both health monitoring (rrd) and network insights (netflow) statistics could be reset in this form.
