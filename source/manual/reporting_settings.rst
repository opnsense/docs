===================
Reporting Settings
===================

Some basic reporting settings and options can be found under :menuselection:`Reporting --> Settings`.

Unbound DNS is capable of collecting statistics for insight into DNS traffic. This behaviour is not enabled by default, but can
be enabled in this page. You can also clear any collected data using the "Reset DNS data" button.

The Health reporting uses RRD collection, for which you can disable the statistics collection process, in cases where monitoring is not
relevant or causes too much stress on the system. The option to collect statistics is enabled by default.

For both health monitoring (rrd) and network insights (netflow) statistics could be reset in this form.
