Traceability of configuration changes using Git
====================================================

When seeking a solution to keep full traceability of configuration changes made by (various) users on your firewall,
the git-backup plugin might be a useful addition to your setup.

In order to use this feature, one has to install the git-backup plugin first (in :menuselection:`System->Firmware->Plugins` search for os-git-backup).

.. Warning:

    Since backups using git are stored unecrypted and contain sensitive data, we generally advise not to use public cloud
    providers to store this data. Only use this option if you can guarantee the security of your git backup server.

--------------------------
Concept
--------------------------

Since git backup is a little bit different than the standard backup options available, we will explain briefly how it works using
the diagram below.

.. blockdiag::
  :scale: 100%

    blockdiag {
        default_fontsize = 9;
        node_width = 200;
        node_height = 80;
        default_group_color = "#def7ff";
        config_changed [shape = box, label="Event:\nconfig changed"];
        syslog_ng [shape = beginpoint, label="syslog-ng\nevent handler"];
        configd [shape = endpoint, label="configd\nlistener"];
        git_action [shape = box, label = "git add+commit\nchanged config.xml"];

        config_changed -> syslog_ng;
        syslog_ng -> configd [label = "loosely coupled"];
        configd -> git_action;

        group {
          orientation = portrait
          syslog_ng;
          configd;
        }
    }

When :code:`config.xml` changes happen due to user or api interaction, an event is triggered to which handlers can subscribe
(using :doc:`syshook </development/backend/autorun>`).
Our git-backup plugin subscribes to these events in order to add the received backups and commits these with
information extracted from the received xml file. To prevent the system to lock during backups,
we choose this loosely coupled method. Events which are yet unprocessed are being left in the (existing) backup directory.

.. Note::

    Events are processed from the moment the initial backup is configured, when disabling backups, the (local) changelog itself
    remains active.

Git backup will push collected commits to the upstream repository nightly.
To shorten this default interval, a custom cronjob (see :doc:`Settings </manual/settingsmenu#cron>`) can be
set up, selecting `Remote Backup` as the Command. The regular backup procedure (which is also being triggered using the test
button in the user interface) is responsible for initialising the empty local repository and configuring the upstream target.

.. Note::

    One can always change the upstream target, as long as the newly configured one is either "bare" (empty) or containing the
    exact same content (/change history) as the one used on this firewall.

--------------------------
Initial setup
--------------------------

The configuration part of this plugin is quite basic and offers two types of transport modes, https using a username and
password combination or ssh using public key infrastructure.

=====================================================================================================================

====================================  ===============================================================================
Enable                                Enable backup to the upstream target
URL                                   Target location, which defined transport protocol,
                                      options as ssh://server/project.git or https://server/project.git are allowed here.
Branch                                The branch to push your commits to on the configured url
SSH private key                       When using ssh, make sure to add a private key here
User Name                             Username, when using gitlab and ssh, the default is :code:`git` here
                                      (most of these providers use a single user and identify the user by it's key)
password                              When using https authentication, choose a password here.
====================================  ===============================================================================

Make sure to push to a "bare" upstream repository, when pressing "Setup/Test Git" the initial commits should be send to
your git server.

.. Tip::

    For github and GitLab repositories, please make sure your URL follows this structure: :code:`ssh://github.com/user_name/repo_name.git`.

--------------------------
Conflict resolution
--------------------------

From the user interface no conflict resolution is offered, you need to configure an upstream repository and stick
to it for the lifetime of the firewall. When for some reason a backup needs to be restored and one would like to
stick to the same git repository, manual conflict resolution might be an option. Support on these scenario's is
not offered.

The repository is available on the OPNsense machine in the following directory :code:`/conf/backup/git`.


.. Note::

    Conflict resolution can complicate the solution a lot (merging, fast-forward, ....), for this reason we will not
    accept feature requests trying to push to existing (used) repositories.


--------------------------
Error handling
--------------------------

When errors occur these will be written to the normal system logging, search for :code:`git-backup` in the general
system logging (:menuselection:`System -> Log Files -> General`).

Some standard errors might be returned via the test button, which should provide a clear direction, known ones are:

* **authentication failure** -> username/password combination is not valid or the provided ssh key doesn't match the expected one
* **ssh hostkey changed** -> it looks like a man-in-the-middle attack is happening, if that's not the case and the remote identification
  changed for valid reasons, manual intervention is required (remove the offensive key from :code:`/root/.ssh/known_hosts`)
* **git out of sync** -> unable to synchronize, see "Conflict resolution" for additional info.


--------------------------
Cleanup
--------------------------

The repository is saved locally on the firewall in :code:`/conf/backup/git`, if for some reason one would like to remove the
collected history and start over from scratch, one can safetly remove this directory.

Login using a (ssh) console and remove the git directory in that case (:code:`rm -rf /conf/backup/git`)


.. Note::

    As long as the plugin is installed and /conf/backup/git contains a git repository, the changes will be captured
    (also without an upstream). One could use this knowledge as well to keep a local (only) repository by creating
    a repository without assigning an upstream and leave the backup option disabled.

.. Tip::

    The firewall contains a local backup of the most recent changes (configured in :menuselection:`System -> Configuration -> History`)
    which the config changed event handler uses to feed to the consumers. If after a cleanup one would like to flush
    the collected changes again to the upstream provider, the :code:`/conf/event_config_changed.json` could be removed
    to "forget" about the already handled config events (in which case all backups will be signaled again to all config syshook handlers)
