Changelogs
==========

OPNsense core offers a changelog of the core and the plugins may offer their own changelog,
if they are growing rapidly so the changelog does not fit into core anymore.

Core
====

Core offers a changelog section in the area :menuselection:`System --> Firmware` as an own menu or the dialog will
automatically open in case of an available update.

To open a changelog manually, you can open the Changelog tab, and click the book:
