WireGuard Site-to-Site Setup
============================

------------
Introduction
------------

WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography.
It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache.
It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose
VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.
Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform and widely deployable. It is currently
under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest
VPN solution in the industry.

---------------------
Step 1 - Installation
---------------------

Go to **System->Firmware->Plugins->** and search for **os-wireguard**. 
Install the plugin as usual, refresh and page and the you'll find the client via
**VPN->WireGuard**.

------------------------
Step 2 - Setup WireGuard
------------------------

The setup of a Site-2-Site VPN is very simple. Just go to tab **Server** and create a new instance.
Give it a **Name** and set a desired **Listen Port**. If you have more than one server instance be 
aware that you can use the **Listen Port** only once. For **Tunnel Address** choose a new virtual 
network to run communication over it, just like with OpenVPN or GRE (e.g. 192.168.0.1/24).
**Peers** can not be chosen yet since we have not created them yet. 
After hitting **Save changes** you can reopen the newly created instance, write down your new public
key and give it to the other side. 

When this VPN is set up on OPNsense only do the same on the second machine and exchange the public
keys. Now go to tab **Endpoints** and add the remote site, give it a **Name**, insert the **Public
Key** and the **Tunnel Address** (e.g. 192.168.0.2/24). **Endpoint Address** is the public IP of the
remote site and you can also set optionally the **Endpoint Port**, now hit **Save changes**.

Go back to tab **Server**, open the instance and choose the newly created endpoint in **Peers**.

Now we can **Enable** the VPN in tab **General** and go on with the setup.

-----------------------
Step 3 - Setup Firewall
-----------------------

On **Firewall->Rules** add a new rule on your WAN interface allowing the port you set in your
instance (Protocol UDP). You also have a new interace **Wireguard** in rules, where you can 
set granular rules on connection inside your tunnel.

Your tunnel is now up and running.

-------------------------
Step 4 - Routing networks
-------------------------

If you want to route your internal networks via this VPN just add the network in the 
**Tunnel Address** in **Endpoints** tab (e.g. 10.0.1.0/24). 

That's it!
