.. Tip::

   .. raw:: html

      Although there is no direct relation between users and certificates, one can search the trust store directly
      for certificates using the same common name as the user name. The <i class="fa fa-fw fa-certificate"></i> button
      can be used in that case.


.. Tip::

   .. raw:: html

      To support migrations, it is possible to bulk-export and import users into the local database.
      Use the <i class="fa fa-fw fa-table"></i> button to receive a formatted csv file, which can be imported using the
       <i class="fa fa-fw fa-upload"></i> button. Some sensitive fields (like passwords) are not included in this procedure.



Creating and maintaining API keys
..........................................

.. raw:: html

   Each user can have api keys for machine to machine communication, to create these use the
   <i class="fa fa-fw fa-ticket"></i> button in the grid, which downloads a new key/secret file.


The assigned keys can be found in the "ApiKeys" tab, where you can remove keys that are no longer used.

.. Note::

   Private parts (secret) are only generated once, when lost you will have to generate a new keypair.


Creating Groups
---------------
Go to :menuselection:`System --> Access --> Groups` and click on the **+** sign in the lower right
corner of the form.

Enter a **Group name** and a **Description** and add users to the group.

When users should access resources on this firewall via a group, connect the relevant ones via **Assigned Privileges**.


Validate and change privileges
----------------------------------

The :menuselection:`System --> Access --> Privileges` privileges page offers quick insights into the roles available
and their purpose.

Each component in the same "lives" on it's own path (endpoint), these are collected into privileges for easy
access.

============================================================================

=============== ============================================================
**ID**          *Internal identifier stored in the database*
**Name**        *The name of this privilege*
**Match**       *The different paths this privilege matches on*
**Users**       *The number of users linked directly into this privilege*
**Groups**      *The number of groups linked directly into this privilege*
