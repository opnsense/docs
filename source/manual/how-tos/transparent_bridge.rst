Transparent Filtering Bridge
============================

-------
Warning
-------
The Transparent Filtering Bridge is not compatible with Traffic Shaping.
Do not enable the traffic shaper when using the filtering bridge.

--------
Abstract
--------

A transparent firewall can be used to filter traffic without creating
different subnets. This application is called filtering bridge as it
acts as a bridge connection two interfaces and applies filtering rules
on top of this.

For more information on Filtering Bridged on FreeBSD, see
`filtering-bridges <https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/filtering-bridges/article.html>`__

------------
Requirements
------------

-  For this howto we need a basic installation of OPNsense with factory
   defaults as a starting point.
-  And an appliance with 2 physical interfaces.

--------------
Considerations
--------------

To create this howto version OPNsense 15.7.11 has been used. Some screenshots
maybe outdated, but setting should apply up to at least 17.1.6. If you use a
different version some options can be different.

.. Note::

    The Menu System of the User Interface has been updated with sub items.
    Where tabs are shown in screenshots, these are now likely visible as submenu.

------------------------------
Configuration in 10 easy steps
------------------------------

.. contents::
  :local:

.. Warning::

  During the configuration you will be asked to "Apply" your changes several times,
  however this may affect the current connection. So **don't** apply anything until
  completely finished! You need to Save your changes for each step.


1. Disable Outbound NAT rule generation
---------------------------------------

To disable outbound NAT, go to
**Firewall** -> **NAT** -> **Outbound**: Disable Outbound NAT rule generation

2. Change system tuneables
--------------------------

Enable filtering bridge by changing **net.link.bridge.pfil\_bridge**
from default to 1 in **System** -> **Settings** -> **System Tuneables**

|Filtering Bridge Step 2.png|

And disable filtering on member interfaces by changing
**net.link.bridge.pfil\_member** from default to 0 in
**System** -> **Settings** -> **System Tuneables**

3. Create the bridge
--------------------

Create a bridge of LAN and WAN, go to
**Interfaces** -> **Other Types** -> **Bridge** :Add Select LAN and WAN.

4. Assign a management IP/Interface
-----------------------------------

To be able to configure and manage the filtering bridge (OPNsense)
afterwards, we will need to assign a new interface to the bridge and
setup an IP address.

Go to **Interfaces** -> **Assign** -> **Available network ports** , select
the bridge from the list and hit **+**.

Now Add an IP address to the interface that you would like to use to
manage the bridge. Go to **Interfaces** -> **OPT1** enable the interface
and fill-in the ip/netmask.

5. Disable Block private networks & bogon
-----------------------------------------

For the WAN interface we nee to disable blocking of private networks & bogus IPs.

Goto **Interfaces** -> **WAN** and unselect **Block private networks**
and **Block bogon networks**.

6. Disable the DHCP server on LAN
---------------------------------

To disable the DCP server on LAN goto **Services** -> **DHCP Server** -> **LAN** and
unselect enable.

7. Add Allow rules
-------------------
After configuring the bridge the rules on member interfaces (WAN/LAN) will be
ignored. So you can skip this step.

Add the allow rules for all traffic on each of the three interfaces (WAN/LAN/OPT1).

This step is to ensure we have a full transparent bridge without any filtering
taking place. You can setup the correct rules when you have confirmed the bridge
to work properly.

Goto **Firewall** -> **Rules** and add a rule per interface to allow all traffic
of any type.

8. Disable Default Anti Lockout Rule
------------------------------------
After configuring the bridge the rules on member interfaces (WAN/LAN) will be
ignored. So you can skip this step.

As we now have setup allow rules for each interface we can safely remove
the Anti Lockout rule on LAN

Goto **Firewall** -> **Settings** -> **Admin Access** :Anti-lockout and select
this option to disable

9. Set LAN and WAN interface type to 'none'
-------------------------------------------

Now remove the IP subnets in use for LAN and WAN by changing the
interface type to none. Goto **Interfaces** -> **LAN** & **Interfaces** -> **WAN**
to do so.

10. Now apply the changes
-------------------------

If you followed each step, then you can now apply the changes. The
Firewall is now converted to a filtering bridge.

.. rubric:: Done.. ready to set your own filtering rules
   :name: done..-ready-to-set-your-own-filtering-rules

Now you can create the correct firewall/filter rules and apply them. To
acces the firewall you need to use the IP adress you configured for the
OPT1 Interface.

.. WARNING::

    Rules need to be configured on the bridge. Rules on member interfaces will
    be ignored!

.. TIP::

  Don't forget to make sure your PC/Laptop is configured with an IP adress that
  falls within the IP range of the OPT1 subnet!
