**Orange France IPTV setup**
============================

**Original Author:** Kev Willers

**Introduction**
-----------------
This guide is for setting up Orange France IPTV and assumes you already have a working internet connection.


**Getting ready**
-----------------

Orange uses two VLANs for TV. VLAN 838 and 840 
Create and assign them as shown.

.. image:: images/tv_image01.png
	:scale: 100%

Take note of the PCP values

Assign the VLANs as shown and also assign TVLAN for use later.

	:scale: 100% 

igb0 is the WAN in this example. Select the interface that corresponds to WAN in your setup.

TVLAN is assigned to a free port on your router which the TVDecoder is plugged into later.


**VLAN 838 setup**
------------------

.. image:: images/tv_image04.png
	:scale: 100%

SEND OPTIONS

dhcp-client-identifier 1:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx,      
REPLACE xx with MAC Address of the Livebox (NOT the TVDecoder) the leading 1 is important

dhcp-class-identifier "sagem",

user-class "'FSVDSL_livebox.MLTV.softathome.Livebox3".   
NOTE the leading â€˜  before the string. Also although not strictky necessary Livebox3 part of the string is for LiveBox3 users if you are Livebox4 user change as required.


REQUEST OPTIONS

subnet-mask,routers, ntp-servers, www-server, classless-routes


**VLAN 840 setup**
------------------

	:scale: 100%

.. image:: images/tv_image06.png
	:scale: 100%

The dummy IP address is important or IGMPproxy does not start 


**TVLAN setup**
---------------

(not needed to make things work, but much neater config and prevents IGMPproxy warning messages on LAN)


.. image:: images/tv_image07.png
	:scale: 100% 


.. image:: images/tv_image08.png
	:scale: 100% 


Use a different subnet to current LAN 

Turn on the DHCP service for TVLAN

NOTE YOU MUST specify the ORANGE DNS servers for the TV to work 

.. image:: images/tv_image09.png
	:scale: 100% 

Now reboot and you should have an IP address on VLAN 838 of 10.x.x.x


**IGMPproxy setup**
-------------------

The latest version of IGMPproxy has bugs which are being corrected.
Until that is complete version 1.2 MUST be used.

Install this version using  

# pkg add -f https://pkg.opnsense.org/FreeBSD:11:amd64/snapshots/igmpproxy-0.1_2,1.txz

Then, lock the package in place to stop future updates of OPNsense overwriting it. 

# pkg lock igmpproxy

Once complete we can configure IGMPproxy as follows

	:scale: 100% 


NOTE: downstream interface is TVLAN

**FIREWALL setup**
------------------

We need to allow traffic to flow on the VLANs and TVLAN and also to connect with Orange servers

.. image:: images/tv_image13.png
	:scale: 100% 

.. image:: images/tv_image14.png
	:scale: 100% 

NOTE the Source is "*"

.. image:: images/tv_image15.png
	:scale: 100% 

And finally the outbound

.. image:: images/tv_image16.png
	:scale: 100% 

Make sure you have clicked Save & Apply 
 
It is advisable at this point to reboot the system.

Plug in your TVDecoder to the port defined for TVLAN, turn on the decoder and after a few minutes you should see TV.
