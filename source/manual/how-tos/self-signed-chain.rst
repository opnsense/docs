This how-to describes the process of creating **self-signed certificate chains**
with OPNsense as PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).

The following section starts with a small overview of PKI, digital certificates, and trust.


Introduction to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
==================================================

A **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** is a framework used to manage digital keys and certificates. PKI supports **asymmetric encryption**, where two related keys – a public key and a private key – are used together to secure communications and authenticate users.

OPNsense provides its own PKI in :menuselection:`System --> Trust`.


Components of PKI
-----------------

- **Certificate Authority (CA)**: The trusted entity that issues and verifies digital certificates.
- **Registration Authority (RA)**: Assists the CA by verifying entities before certificates are issued.
- **Digital Certificates**: Bind public keys to individuals or entities, confirming identity.
- **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**: A list of certificates that have been revoked, used to manage trust.

When creating and using your own PKI, the above components depend on compliance. When you are a home user or manage a small company network, these can all be fulfilled by a single person or a small team. In large infrastructures, PKI management needs careful considerations.


How PKI Works
-------------

1. The CA issues a digital certificate containing the entity's public key.
2. A sender uses the public key to encrypt information sent to the certificate holder.
3. The certificate holder uses their private key to decrypt the information.
4. Digital signatures can also be created with the private key and verified by others using the public key.

Together, PKI enables secure data exchange, authentication, and digital identity verification.


Public and Private Keys
-----------------------

In PKI, each entity has a unique pair of cryptographic keys:

- **Public Key**: The public key is shared openly. It is used to encrypt data that can only be decrypted by the matching private key. It is also used to verify digital signatures created by the private key. Public keys are included in digital certificates to enable secure exchanges.

- **Private Key**: The private key is kept secret by the owner. It decrypts data that was encrypted with the matching public key and creates digital signatures that can be verified by the public key. Protecting the private key is essential.


Understanding Trust
---------------------------------------

Trust in certificates refers to the confidence that the certificate’s issuer has verified identity and authenticity.
This is less of a technical term, but trust between either real people or organizations who issue and verify certificates.
The actual action of trust is when you install a CA certificate in your operating systems trust store. If the CA certificate has been pre-installed by
a third party organization, you trust that organization by keeping it in your trust store.

**Trust in CA-Issued Certificates**

When using a CA-issued certificate, trust is based on identity verification, as the CA verifies the identity of certificate requesters; compliance, as CAs follow industry standards and are regularly audited; and widespread recognition, since CA root certificates are pre-trusted in most systems.

**Trust in Self-Signed Certificates**

For self-signed certificates, trust relies on the issuer’s security practices and if you want to trust their self-signed CA.
Users must accept or install the certificate in their operating system trust store.
Compromise of a self-signed certificate has higher risks, as there is likely no automatic revocation process.
Using them for publicly accessible services introduces constraints due to lack of third-party validation and automatic trust.


Certificate Chains
--------------------------------------------

Certificate chains enable verification of multiple levels of certificates, rather than relying on the validation of a single, isolated certificate.

Should you consider using self-signed certificate chains when free and widely recognized certificates are readily available?

- Self-signed certificates can be just as secure as publicly trusted certificates.
- They establish a chain of trust, where each party is well-known and directly controlled.
- You have full control of the PKI and the validity of each certificate. No external party can invalidate the certificates.

For a functional certificate chain, you will need at least a root CA and a leaf certificate (end-entity certificate). An intermediate CA is not required but adds a layer of security: if compromised, only the intermediate CA is affected, protecting the root CA key.

.. Attention::

    To enhance security:

    - Store the root CA private key offline, such as on a USB or secure drive, kept in a safe location inaccessible to potential malware or unauthorized access.
    - Keep multiple copies of the private key in different locations.
    - The intermediate CA, generally with a shorter lifecycle, may be stored on a firewall host.


Creating a Certificate Chain
====================================

We will create a certificate chain using the following components:

- **Root CA**: Self-signed → Signs intermediate certificates
- **Intermediate CA**: Signed by the Root CA → Signs leaf certificates
- **Leaf Certificate**: Signed by the Intermediate CA → Server or user certificate

**Important**: Ensure all data is backed up before proceeding.

===================================== =======================================================================================================================

Press **Save** and the intermediate CA has been created. The private and public key are saved on the OPNsense.


Step 3: Issuing a Leaf Certificate
-----------------------------------------

Go to :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Certificates`

Press **+** to create a new authority, it will become your leaf certificate (end-entity certificate).
It can be used on a server, user, or both; depending on the type.

===================================== =======================================================================================================================
**Options**                           **Description**
===================================== =======================================================================================================================
**Method**                            ``Create an internal Certificate``
**Description**                       ``leaf-certificate.example.com`` (or a custom description, like user or server name)
**Key**
**Type**                              ``Server Certificate`` (or client certificate for a user)

**Digest Algorithm**                  ``SHA256`` (or higher)
**Issuer**                            ``Intermediate CA``
**Lifetime (days)**                   ``365`` (after this expires the leaf certificate must be recreated)
**General**
**Country Code**                      ``Netherlands`` (your country)
**State or Province**                 ``Zuid-Holland`` (your state or empty)
**City**                              ``Middelharnis`` (your city or empty)
**Organization**                      ``Deciso B.V.`` (your organization name or empty)
**Organizational Unit**               ``IT`` (your organizational unit or leave empty)
**Email Address**                     ``info@example.com`` (your email address, it is best practice to use a real existing one)
**Common Name**                       ``leaf-certificate.example.com`` (or a custom name)
**OCSP URI**                          `leave empty`
**Alternative Names**
**DNS Domain Names**                  ``leaf-certificate.example.com`` (or a custom name)
===================================== =======================================================================================================================

Press **Save** and the leaf certificate has been created. The private and public key are saved on the OPNsense.

.. Note::

   The private key does not have to be stored. For higher security, only download it by setting the Private Key Location to the alternative option.
   This way, the private key can be installed on the required server without a copy in the OPNsense trust store.
   To issue leaf certificates, only the Intermediate CAs need their private keys stored in the trust store.

.. Tip::

   Additional leaf certificates can be issued with the same intermediate CA. Each level in the chain is a one-to-many relationship. One root CA can issue many
   intermediate CAs, one intermediate CA can issue many leaf certificates.


The next step will be exporting the certificate chain, and using the leaf certificate on an external webserver.


Step 4: Exporting the Certificate Chain
-----------------------------------------

Now that we have the whole certificate chain, we create a certificate bundle for a generic linux apache web server.

For that, we need two files:

- A certificate bundle populated in the correct order in PEM format:

    #. Root CA
    #. Intermediate CA
    #. Leaf Certificate

- The private key of the leaf certificate

#. Export Root CA public key:

    - Go to :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Authorities`
    - Press the download button in the `Commands` column of the ``Root CA`` row
    - Choose `File type: Certificate` and press `Download`

#. Export Intermediate CA public key:

    - Go to :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Authorities`
    - Press the download button in the `Commands` column of the ``Intermediate CA`` row
    - Choose `File type: Certificate` and press `Download`

#. Export Leaf Certificate public key:

    - Go to :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Certificates`
    - Press the download button in the `Commands` column of the ``Leaf Certificate`` row
    - Choose `File type: Certificate` and press `Download`

#. Export Leaf Certificate private key:

    - Go to :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Certificates`
    - Press the download button in the `Commands` column of the ``Leaf Certificate`` row
    - Choose `File type: Private Key` and press `Download`

Open a text editor and create a file with all 3 public keys:

``certificate-bundle.pem``

.. code-block::

The key of the certificate bundle is only the leaf certificate's private key. Private keys of root and intermediate CAs are **not** required.

Implement these into your webserver, and the website will be secured with this certificate bundle.
For automatic trust, you must install the intermediate and/or root CA certificate public keys into any client that connects to the webserver.
Since the webserver offers a full certificate chain to the connecting client, manual trust can be established if a user decides to install the public key themselves.
