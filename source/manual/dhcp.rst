DHCP
====

DHCP is used to automatically provide clients with an IP address (instead of clients having to set one themselves).
DHCP is available for both IPv4 and IPv6 clients, referred to as DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, respectively.

DHCPv4 settings can be found at **Services -> DHCPv4**. DHCPv6 settings can be found at **Services -> DHCPv6**.

The DHCPv4 submenu further consists of:

* An entry per interface of general settings, like a toggle to enable/disable DHCPv4 for this interface, DHCP range, DNS serversâ€¦
* **Relay**: DHCP requests can be "forwarded" to another server. This is called relaying.
* **Leases**: Shows all IP addresses that are handed out to clients (can be filtered to only show active and static leases).
* **Log File**: Shows the log file of the DHCPv4 server.

The DHCPv6 submenu further consists of:

* **Relay**: DHCP requests can be "forwarded" to another server. This is called relaying.
* **Leases**: Shows all IP addresses that are handed out to clients (can be filtered to only show active and static leases).
