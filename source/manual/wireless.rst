Wireless
==============================

Although wireless networks are supported in OPNsense, result may vary.

In our experience most companies use separate access points to facilitate WiFi, for reasons as supported technology
(nowadays most devices expect wireless-ac, which isn't supported), stable hardware and often the location where
the firewall is installed plays an important role (signal strength issues).


Our documentation on the subject is limited, contributions will be shown below.
