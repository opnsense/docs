This manual provides a quick overview of ndproxy and how to configure it for general use.


Introduction to ndproxy
==================================================

Ndproxy is a kernel module that acts as a proxy for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) messages between a Provider Edge (PE) router
and Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).

When ndproxy runs on the same device as the CPE (e.g., OPNsense), it allows the device
to act as both the home networkâ€™s router and the proxy for handling ND messages. This setup is particularly useful in cases
where an ISP only provides limited IPv6 delegation (e.g., a single /64 prefix). By using ndproxy, such limitations can be
bypassed to allow the LAN to use the ISP provided prefix.

For more technical details: `ndproxy(4) <https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ndproxy>`_


Installation
--------------------------------------------------

Install ``os-ndproxy`` from :menuselection:`System --> Firmware --> Plugins`.


Important configuration details
--------------------------------------------------

- **Promiscuous Mode**:
    The listening interface (WAN) must be set to promiscuous mode.
    If it is a VLAN, it must be set on the parent interface.
    Otherwise the router can not join multicast groups to respond to solicitations for hosts in the LAN.

- **IPv6 Global Unicast Address**:
    The WAN and LAN interface must not configure a GUA in the same /64 prefix. If a GUA on WAN is required,
    ensure it is /128.


Simple Setup for Home Users
==================================================

.. Note::

   Follow if you are a home user with a single /64 delegated prefix, or if your router is in a SLAAC only network, e.g. mobile network via modem.

**Uplink IPv6 Addresses**                       ``fe80::200:ff:fe00:0``
                                                (Link-local address of the ISP router)
**Exception IPv6 Addresses**                    `leave empty`
==============================================  ====================================================================

.. Note::

   The MAC address can be found in :menuselection:`Interfaces --> Overview`. Click the details button of
   the WAN interface.

.. Note::

   The link-local address of the ISP router can be found in :menuselection:`System --> Routes --> Status`.
   Search for the ipv6 default route, the `Gateway` of this route will be the link local address; ``fe80::200:ff:fe00:0%igb0``.
   Only use the part before ``%``, in this case ``fe80::200:ff:fe00:0``.


After applying the configuration, all devices in your LAN network will autogenerate a GUA with SLAAC and receive
the OPNsense as their default gateway. Check the firewall rules on LAN if IPv6 is allowed to any destination.
Verify the setup by pinging an IPv6 location on the internet.

If you want to take a deeper dive, read the next section for an in depth explanation of the whole infrastructure and
detailed troubleshooting.


Advanced Setup for Internet Service Providers
==================================================

.. Note::

   This section is for ISPs or advanced users. It explains a concept how to delegate single /64 prefixes to subscriber upstream routers.

.. Attention::

   If there is a switch between the PE and CPE router, ensure there is no MLD or Multicast (IGMP) snooping configured
   on the peering VLAN.


To explain this setup in more detail, two OPNsense will be used to simulate the PE and CPE router.

.. Note::

   If you plan for multiple CPE Routers, ensure each of them is in its own isolated VLAN.


Setup PE Router
--------------------------------------------------

We assume:

    - The network on the PEERING interface is ``2001:db8::/56``
    - We delegate ``2001:db8::/64`` downstream to a router in the CUSTOMER network
    - The interface setup is like the provided network diagram


Go to :menuselection:`Interfaces --> CUSTOMER`

==============================================  ====================================================================
**IPv6 Configuration Type**                     ``Static IPv6``
**IPv6 address**                                ``2001:db8::1/64``
==============================================  ====================================================================

Go to :menuselection:`Services --> ISC DHCPv6 --> CUSTOMER`

==============================================  ====================================================================
**Enable**                                      ``X``
**Range**                                       from: ``2001:db8::2`` to: ``2001:db8::2``
**Prefix Delegation Range**                     from: ``2001:db8::`` to: ``2001:db8::``
**Prefix Delegation Size**                      ``64``
==============================================  ====================================================================

Go to :menuselection:`Services --> Router Advertisements --> CUSTOMER`

==============================================  ====================================================================
**Router Advertisements**                       ``Router Only``
**Advertise Default Gateway**                   ``X``
==============================================  ====================================================================

With this configuration, the ``2001:db8::/64`` network will be delegated to the downstream CPE router. It will receive ``2001:db8::2/128`` on its WAN interface, and
a default IPv6 route to the PE router's LLA ``fe80::1`` on the CUSTOMER interface.


Setup CPE Router
--------------------------------------------------

This is the OPNsense attached to the PE router, it will receive the delegated /64 Prefix on its WAN interface. The goal is to use this prefix on the
LAN interface by proxying NDP messages with ndproxy. Without it, only the router itself could use this network as host.

==============================================  ====================================================================
**IPv6 Configuration Type**                     ``DHCPv6``
**Promiscous Mode**                             ``X`` 
                                                (important to respond to all NDP Multicasts)
**Prefix Delegation Size**                      ``64``
**Request Prefix Only**                         ``X``
                                                (optional)
==============================================  ====================================================================

.. Note::

   `Request Prefix Only` is optional, but needed if the WAN interface would autoconfigure a /64 GUA.
   Since that would break routing this setting is recommended. If WAN autoconfigures a /128 GUA,
   this setting can stay disabled.

=============================================================================  =====================================

.. Note::

   `Allow manual adjustement of DHCPv6 and Router Advertisements` is optional, not setting it makes configuration easier.
   Only set it if you need to make manual adjustements, like sending an IPv6 DNS Server, configure DHCPv6 or change Router Priority.

==============================================  ====================================================================


Confirming the Setup
--------------------------------------------------

Introduce a client to the CPE router's LAN. This client will autoconfigure an IPv6 GUA inside the delegated /64 prefix, e.g., ``2001:db8::200/64``.
Ping an IPv6 only destination on the internet. The ping should work. If you disable the ndproxy service, the ping should stop working.

This happens because without ndproxy, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) messages are not relayed between the WAN and LAN interfaces of the CPE router.

.. Attention::

   Since there is no DAD (Duplicate Address Detection) Proxy between WAN and LAN, if the same IPv6 GUAs are used in both segments, there can be address conflicts.
   This can also happen with auto generated IPv6 addresses, so make sure you limit their use in the WAN segment to only necessary ones.


Packet Flow Explained
--------------------------------------------------

1. **LAN Client**

   The IPv6 client on the LAN (e.g., with address ``2001:db8::200/64``) initiates a ping to an IPv6-only destination on the internet.
   The client sends the ICMPv6 Echo Request to its default gateway, which is the CPE router's LAN interface (``fe80::1``).

2. **CPE Router**

   The CPE router receives the packet on its LAN interface and forwards it out through its WAN interface (``2001:db8::2/128`` or ``fe80::2/64``)
   towards the PE router. Since the packet is destined for an external network, the CPE router uses its routing table to send the packet upstream.

3. **PE Router**

   The PE router receives the packet on CUSTOMER and forwards it to the intended internet destination in PEERING.
   The external host responds with an ICMPv6 Echo Reply, which is routed back to the PE router.

   To deliver the Echo Reply to the LAN client (``2001:db8::200``), the PE router must resolve the client's IPv6 address to a link-layer (MAC) address.
   The PE router sends a NDP **Neighbor Solicitation** message for ``2001:db8::200`` out of its CUSTOMER interface to the WAN interface of the CPE router.

4. **Role of ndproxy**

    - The **ndproxy** service on the CPE router listens for NDP messages on the WAN interface.
    - When the Neighbor Solicitation arrives at the CPE router's WAN interface, **ndproxy** intercepts it and proxies it to the LAN interface.
    - The LAN client receives the Neighbor Solicitation and responds with a Neighbor Advertisement, providing its MAC address.
    - **ndproxy** proxies this Neighbor Advertisement back to the WAN interface, sending it to the PE router's CUSTOMER interface.
    - The PE router now has the necessary link-layer information to forward the ICMP Echo Reply to the LAN client.
